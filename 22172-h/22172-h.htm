		<h2 class="title">NAPOLEON BONAPARTE.</h2>

		<p class="byline">BY THOMAS CARLYLE.</p>

		<p><span class="first_word">The</span> following article has been compiled from the different works of
		<span class="first_word">Thomas Carlyle</span>, and embodies all he has written, or at least published,
		about Napoleon Bonaparte. We offer it in the absence of a more elaborate
		work on this subject, which we hope one day to see from the pen
		of this gifted and earnest writer. It is a glimpse of the insight of the
		clearest-headed Seer of our age, into the noisiest great man of the last,
		about whom we listen with pleasure to each new voice, perhaps critically
		and doubtingly, yet for our own part colored by that absorbing,
		painful interest, which induced us when a boy to close the book which
		first told us of his doings, after having traced his meteoric flight to the
		&#8216;monster meeting&#8217; at Moscow, unable to proceed to the catastrophe;
		and it was months before we could bring ourselves to read on, of the
		heroism which charmed, or the glitter which dazzled us, to its final
		chaos and night. On Napoleon&#8217;s right to the title great, the character
		of his greatness, and what would be left if the smoke-clouds, battle-glory
		and so on were torn away, we will offer but a few words. Of the
		title in its best sense but few now believe him worthy, perhaps no thinker
		or reflecting man. He is a volcano rather than a sun, a destroyer more
		than a creator; and our sympathy is mingled with little of that which
		we feel for the martyr; who dies rather than sell his birthright, heaven,
		for any mess of earth&#8217;s pottage, or for him who spends his life in the
		search for truth, and in speaking it to mankind, taking no heed for himself
		what he shall eat and wherewithal he shall be clad. No! the
		feeling is far more akin to that which we have for a deep-playing gambler,
		whom we know to have some noble impulses. How eagerly, yet
		sorrowingly we watch his movements! The dice rattle, they are thrown,
		and again thrown; thousands after thousands he wins and lays aside;
		and at last, in the madness of the game, stakes the whole sum, with his
		house, estate, all on the hazard of one cast. With beating heart we
		listen to the rattling of the dice, and with strained gaze watch the blow.
		The box is lifted&#8212;all is lost. Now we are excited by the daring of this
		<a class="pagenum" id="page410" title="410"></a>being, and feel deeply, more so if we know him to have something of a
		better nature, some nobler impulses, but the interest is still in the great
		gambler, not in the great <em>man</em>; and though his boldness startles, and
		for the moment carries us away, yet ever with our admiration comes a
		still small voice from the &#8216;inner sanctuary,&#8217; which whispers of those
		whom his winnings ruined, or the dependents who were reduced to beggary
		by his loss. Would the <em>great</em> man have played the game at all?</p>

		<p>We have always felt that Napoleon stepped down from his greatness
		when he let them hurry him away alive to that island-prison; and there
		is reasoning in this feeling itself, which most persons feel on reading of
		his career, which his worshippers would do well to consider in its various
		bearings; for if Napoleon, (when the royal guard, his last hope, was
		cut to pieces at Waterloo, and crying to Bertrand, &#8216;It is finished,&#8217; he
		turned and fled,) had placed himself before the last cannon which sent
		destruction to his foes, and let its ball end his career and life together,
		who is there but would feel that he was acting truer to his greatness,
		than to &#8216;eat his heart away&#8217; a captive? If throughout his career we
		had seen the brave fighter for country, for principle, for right, instead
		of for self, this feeling would never arise. Place <span class="special_name">Washington</span> in a
		similar situation; imagine him to have believed it best to gather all his
		country could give him of hardy defenders, and on the result of one battle
		let his country&#8217;s fate be decided. The battle is fought and lost; his
		army is routed and cut to pieces; he has asked for liberty with his whole
		strength, with his whole soul, and the answer is &#8216;No!&#8217; written with
		bayonets in blood, and voiced by the enemy&#8217;s cannon. Would <span class="special_name">Washington</span>
		have been true to <em>his</em> greatness in placing himself before the last
		cannon? No! emphatically, no! With Napoleon he might have
		cried, &#8216;It is finished,&#8217; but then with the same calm brow yet bursting
		heart, he would have resigned his sword to his conquerors; and if the
		scaffold were his fate, met it with quiet dignity; or if the dungeon,
		there calmly await the Almighty&#8217;s time when he might again raise his
		right arm for his country; still as great in the prison or on the scaffold,
		as when he was at the head of conquering armies. Napoleon&#8217;s intellectual
		character was perceptive rather than deep; and there is an intense
		concentrativeness about him, a power of throwing the whole effort
		of his soul into the environment of the moment, which is remarkable;
		and not less so the facility with which he changes that concentration
		from place to place, from subject to subject. Probably no man ever
		had his whole mind so much under the control of his will, at his fingers&#8217;
		ends, as it were; &#8216;the eye to see and the will to do.&#8217; But revert we to
		<span class="special_name">Carlyle</span>.</p>

		<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">Some</span> call for Barras to be made commandant; he conquered in Thermidor.
		Some, what is more to the purpose, bethink them of the Citizen
		<span class="special_name">Bonaparte</span>, unemployed artillery officer who took Toulon. A man of
		head, a man of action: Barras is named Commandant&#8217;s Cloak; this
		young artillery officer is named Commandant. He was in the gallery
		at the moment, and heard it; he withdrew some half hour to consider
		with himself: after a half-hour of grim compressed considering, to be
		<a class="pagenum" id="page411" title="411"></a>or not to be, he answers <em>yea</em>. And now, a man of head being at the
		head of it, the whole matter gets vital. Swift to camp of Sablon, to
		secure the artillery; there are not twenty men guarding it! A swift
		adjutant, Murat is the name of him, gallops, gets thither some minutes
		within time, for Lepelletier was also on march that way: the cannon
		are ours. And now beset this post and beset that; rapid and firm; at
		Wicket of the Louvre, in Cul-de-sac Dauphin, in Rue St. Honoré, from
		Pont Neuf all along the North Quays, southward to the Pont <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ci-devant</em>
		Royal, rank round the sanctuary of the Tuilleries, a ring of steel discipline;
		let every gunner have his match burning, and all men stand to
		their arms. Lepelletier has seized the Church of Saint Roche; has
		seized the Pont Neuf, our piquet there retreating thence without fire.
		Stray shots fall from Lepelletier, rattle down on the very Tuilleries&#8217;
		stair-case. On the other hand, women advance dishevelled, shrieking
		peace; Lepelletier behind them waving his hat in sign that we shall
		fraternize. Steady! The artillery officer is steady as bronze; can, if
		need were, be quick as lightning. Lepelletier making nothing by messengers
		by fraternity or hat-waving, bursts out, along the southern Quai
		Voltaire, along streets and passages, treble-quick in huge veritable onslaught!
		Whereupon thou bronze artillery officer&#8212;? &#8216;Fire&#8217;! say the
		bronze lips. And roar and thunder, roar and again roar, continual, volcano-like,
		goes his great gun, in the Cul-de-sac Dauphin against the
		Church of Saint Roch; go his great guns on the Pont Royal; go all
		his great guns&#8212;blow to air some two hundred men, mainly about the
		Church of Saint Roch! Lepelletier cannot stand such harsh play; no
		sectioner can stand it; the forty thousand yield on all sides scour toward
		covert. The ship is over the bar; free she bounds shoreward&#8212;amid
		shouting and vivats! Citizen Bonaparte is &#8216;named General of the Interior
		by acclamation;&#8217; quelled sections have to disarm in such humor
		as they may; sacred right of insurrection is gone forever! &#8216;It is false,&#8217;
		says Napoleon, &#8216;that we fired first with blank charge; it had been a
		waste of life to do that.&#8217; Most false; the firing was with sharp and
		sharpest shot: to all men it was plain that here was no sport; the rabbits
		and plinths of Saint Roch Church show splintered by it to this hour.
		Singular: in old Broglie&#8217;s time, six years ago, this whiff of grape shot
		was promised; but it could not be given then; could not have profited
		then. Now, however, the time has come for it and the man; and behold
		you have it; and the thing we specifically call <em>French Revolution</em> is
		blown into space by it and become a thing that was!</p>

		<p>The French revolution did disclose original men: among the twenty-five
		millions, at least one or two units. Some reckon in the present
		stage of the business, as many as three: Napoleon, Danton, Mirabeau.
		Whether more will come to light, or of what sort, when the computation
		is quite liquidated, one cannot say. Meanwhile, let the world be
		thankful for these three; as indeed, the world is; loving original men,
		without limit, were they never so questionable, well knowing how rare
		they are! To us, accordingly, it is rather interesting to observe how
		on these three also, questionable as they surely are, the old process is
		repeating itself; how these also are getting known in their true likeness.
		A second generation, relieved in some measure from the spectral
		<a class="pagenum" id="page412" title="412"></a>hallucinations, hysterical ophthalmia, and natural panic-delirium of the
		first contemporary one, is gradually coming to discern and measure
		what its predecessor could only execrate and shriek over; for, as our
		proverb said, the dust is sinking, the rubbish-heaps disappear; the built
		house, such as it is, and was appointed to be, stands visible, better or
		worse. Of Napoleon Bonaparte, with so many bulletins, and such self-proclamation
		from artillery and battle-thunder, loud enough to ring
		through the deafest brain, in the remotest nook of this earth, and now,
		in consequence, with so many biographies, histories and historical arguments
		for and against, it may be said he can now shift for himself; that
		his true figure is in a fair way of being ascertained. Doubtless it will
		be found one day, what significance was in him; how, (we quote from
		a New-England book,) &#8216;the man was a divine missionary, though unconscious
		of it; and preached through the cannon&#8217;s throat that great
		doctrine, <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La carrière ouverte aux talens</em>, (the tools to him who can handle
		them,) which is our ultimate Political Evangel, wherein alone can
		Liberty lie. Madly enough he preached it is true, as enthusiasts and
		first missionaries are wont; with imperfect utterance, amid much frothy
		rant; yet as articulately, perhaps, as the case admitted. Or call him
		if you will, an American backwoodsman, who had to fell unpenetrated
		forests, and battle with innumerable wolves, and did not entirely forbear
		strong liquor, rioting, and even theft; whom, nevertheless, the
		peaceful sower will follow, and, as he cuts the boundless harvest, bless.&#8217;
		From &#8216;the incarnate Moloch,&#8217; which the world once was, onward to
		to this quiet version, there is a considerable progress.</p>

		<p>What are the conquests and expeditions of the whole corporation of
		captains, from Walter the Pennyless to Napoleon Bonaparte, compared
		with these &#8216;moveable types&#8217; of Johannes Faust? Truly, it is a mortifying
		thing for your conqueror to reflect, how perishable is the metal
		which he hammers with such violence; how the kind earth will soon
		shroud up his bloody foot-prints; and all which he achieved and skilfully
		piled together, will be but like his own &#8216;canvass city&#8217; of a camp; this
		evening loud with life, to-morrow all struck and vanished, &#8216;a few earth-pits
		and heaps of straw!&#8217; For here, as always, it continues true, that
		the deepest force is the stillest; that, as in the fable, the mild shining
		of the sun shall accomplish what the fierce blustering of the tempest has
		in vain essayed. Above all, it is ever to be kept in mind, that not by
		material but by mental power, are men and their actions governed.
		How noiseless is thought! No rolling of drums, no tramp of squadrons
		or immeasurable tumult of baggage-wagons, attends its movements;
		in what obscure and sequestered places may the head be meditating
		which is one day to be crowned with more than imperial authority; for
		kings and emperors will be among its ministering servants; it will rule
		not over, but <em>in</em> all heads, and with these, its solitary combinations of
		ideas, as with magic formulas, bend the world to its will! The time
		may come, when Napoleon himself will be better known for his laws
		than for his battles; and the victory of Waterloo prove less momentous
		than the opening of the first mechanic&#8217;s institute.</p>

		<p>Brother Ringletule, the missionary, inquired of Ram-Dass, a Hindoo
		man-god, who had set up for godhead lately, what he meant to do then
		<a class="pagenum" id="page413" title="413"></a>with the sins of mankind? To which Ram-Dass at once answers, he
		had <em>fire enough in his belly</em> to burn up all the sins in the world. Ram-Dass
		was right so far, and had a spice of sense in him; for surely it is
		the test of every divine man this same, and without it he is not divine
		or great; that he <em>have</em> fire in him to burn up somewhat of the sins of the
		world, of the miseries and errors of the world: why else is he there!
		Far be it from us to say that a great man must needs with benevolence
		prepense, become a &#8216;friend of humanity;&#8217; nay, that such professional
		self-conscious friends are not the fatalest kind of persons to be met with
		in our day. All greatness is unconscious or it is little and naught.
		And yet a great man without <em>such</em> fire in him, burning dim or developed
		as a divine behest in his heart of hearts, never resting till it be fulfilled,
		were a solecism in nature. A great man is ever, as the transcendentalists
		speak, possessed with an <em>idea</em>. Napoleon, himself not the
		superfinest of great men, and balanced sufficiently with prudence and
		egoisms, had nevertheless, as is clear enough, an idea to start with; the
		idea that democracy was the cause of man, the right and infinite cause.
		Nay, to the very last, he had a kind of idea, that, namely, of &#8216;the tools
		to him that can handle them;&#8217; really one of the best ideas yet promulgated
		on that matter, or rather the one true central idea, toward which
		all the others, if they tend any whither, must tend. Unhappily, it was
		only in the military province that Napoleon could realize this idea of
		his, being forced to fight for himself the while; before he got it tried to
		any extent in the civil province of things, his head by much victory grew
		light, (no head can stand more than its quantity,) and he lost head, as
		they say, and became a selfish ambitionist and quack, and was hurled
		out, leaving his idea to be realized, in the civil province of things, by
		others! Thus was Napoleon; thus are all great men: children of the
		idea; or, in Ram-Dass&#8217; phraseology, furnished with fire to burn up the
		miseries of men.</p>

		<p>Napoleon, Danton, Mirabeau, with fire-words (of public speaking)
		and fire whirlwinds (of cannon and musketry,) which for a season darkened
		the air, are perhaps at bottom but superficial phenomena.</p>

		<p>Napoleon was the &#8216;armed soldier of democracy,&#8217; invincible while he
		continued true to that. <span class="omitted_text">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> He does by no means seem to me so
		great a man as Cromwell. His enormous victories, which reached over
		all Europe, while Cromwell abode mainly in our little England, are but
		as high <em>stilts</em> on which the man is seen standing; the stature of the man
		is not altered thereby. I find in him no such sincerity as in Cromwell;
		only a far inferior sort. No silent walking, through long years, with
		the Awful, Unnameable, of this universe; &#8216;walking with God&#8217; as he
		called it; and faith and strength in that alone: <em>latent</em> thought and valor,
		content to lie latent, then burst out as in a blaze of heaven&#8217;s lightning!
		Napoleon lived in an age when God was no longer believed; the meaning
		of all Silence, Latency, was thought to be Nonentity: he had to begin
		not out of the Puritan Bible, but out of poor, sceptical encyclopedias.
		This was the length the man carried it. Meritorious to get so far. His
		compact, prompt, every way articulate character, is in itself perhaps
		small compared with our great chaotic inarticulate Cromwell&#8217;s. Instead
		of &#8216;dumb prophet struggling to speak,&#8217; we have a portentious mixture
		<a class="pagenum" id="page414" title="414"></a>of the Quack! Hume&#8217;s notion of the Fanatic-Hypocrite, with such
		truth as it has, will apply much better to Napoleon than it did to Cromwell,
		to Mahomet or the like, where indeed, taken strictly, it has hardly
		any truth at all. An element of blameable ambition shows itself from
		the first in this man; gets the victory over him at last, and involves him
		and his work in ruin.</p>

		<p>&#8216;False as a bulletin&#8217; became a proverb in Napoleon&#8217;s time. He
		makes what excuse he could for it: that it was necessary to mislead the
		enemy, to keep up his own men&#8217;s courage, etc. On the whole these are
		no excuses. A man in no case has any liberty to tell lies. It had been
		in the long run better for Napoleon too if he had not told any. In fact,
		if a man have any purpose beyond the hour and day, meant to be found
		extant next day, what good can it ever be to promulgate lies? The lies
		are found out; ruinous penalty is exacted for them. No man will believe
		the liar next time, even when he speaks truth, when it is of the
		last importance that he be believed. The old cry of the &#8216;wolf!&#8217; A lie
		is <em>no</em>-thing; you cannot of nothing make something; you make <em>nothing</em>
		at last, and lose your labour in the bargain.</p>

		<p>Yet Napoleon <em>had</em> a sincerity: we are to distinguish between what is
		superficial and what is fundamental insincerity. Across these outer
		manœuvrings and quackeries of his, which were many and most
		blameable, let us discern withal that the man had a certain instinctive
		ineradicable feeling for reality; and did base himself upon fact so long
		as he had any basis. He has an instinct of nature better than his
		culture was. His <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savans</em>, Bourrienne tells us, in that voyage to Egypt
		were one evening busily occupied arguing that there could be no God.
		They had proved it to their satisfaction by all manner of logic. Napoleon,
		looking up into the stars, answers, &#8216;Very ingenious, Messieurs;
		but <em>who made</em> all that?&#8217; The Atheistic logic runs off from him like
		water; the great Fact stares him in the face. &#8216;Who made all that?&#8217;
		So too in practice; he, as every man that can be great, or have victory
		in this world, sees through all entanglements, the practical heart of the
		matter; drives straight toward that. When the steward of his Tuilleries
		Palace was exhibiting the new upholstery, with praises and demonstrations,
		how glorious it was and how cheap withal, Napoleon, making little
		answer, asked for a pair of scissors, clipped one of the gold tassels
		from a window-curtain, put it in his pocket, and walked on. Some days
		afterward he produced it at the right moment, to the horror of the
		upholstery functionary: it was not gold but tinsel! In Saint Helena, it
		is notable how he still, to his last days, insists on the practical, the real.
		&#8216;Why talk and complain? Above all, why quarrel with one another?
		There is no <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">resultat</em> in it; it comes to nothing that we can <em>do</em>. Say nothing
		if one can do nothing!&#8217; He speaks often so to his poor, discontented
		followers; he is like a piece of silent Strength in the middle of
		their morbid querulousness there.</p>

		<p>And accordingly, was there not what we can call a <em>faith</em> in him, genuine
		as far as it went? That this new enormous Democracy, asserting
		itself here in the French revolution is an insuppressible fact, which the
		whole world, with its old forces and institutions cannot put down: this
		was a true insight of his, and took his conscience along with it&#8212;a
		<a class="pagenum" id="page415" title="415"></a><em>faith</em>. And did he not interpret the dim purport of it well? &#8216;The implements
		to him who can handle them.&#8217; This actually is the truth, and
		even the whole truth; it includes whatever the French revolution, or
		any revolution could mean. Napoleon, in his first period, was a true
		Democrat. And yet by the nature of him, fastened too by his military
		trade, he knew that democracy, if it were a true thing at all, could not
		be an anarchy: the man had a heart-hatred for anarchy. On that
		twentieth of June, (1792,) Bourrienne and he sat in a coffee-house as
		the mail rolled by. Napoleon expresses the deepest contempt for persons
		in authority that they do not restrain this rabble. On the tenth of
		August he wonders there is no one to command these poor Swiss; they
		could conquer if there were. Such a faith in democracy, yet hatred of
		anarchy it is, that carries Napoleon through all his great work.
		Through his brilliant Italian campaigns, onward to the peace of Luben,
		one would say his inspiration is: &#8216;Triumph to the French revolution;
		assertion of it against these Austrian Simulacra that pretend to call it a
		simulacrum!&#8217; Withal, however, he feels, and has a right to feel, how
		necessary a strong authority is; how the revolution cannot prosper at
		all without such. To bridle in that great devouring, self-devouring
		French revolution; to <em>tame</em> it, so that its intrinsic purpose can be made
		good; that it may become organic, and be able to live amongst other
		organisms and <em>formed</em> things, not as a wasting destruction alone; is not
		this still what he partly aimed at, as the true purport of his life; nay,
		what he actually managed to do? Through Wagrams, Austerlitzes;
		triumph after triumph; he triumphed so far. There was an eye to
		see in this man, a soul to dare and do. He rose naturally to be the
		king. All men saw that he <em>was</em> such. The common soldiers used to
		say on the march: &#8216;These babbling <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">avocats</em> up at Paris: all talk and
		no work? What wonder it runs all wrong! We shall have to go and
		put our <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit corporal</em> there!&#8217; They went and put him there; they and
		France at large. Chief-consulship, emperorship, victory over Europe;
		till the poor lieutenant of <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Fère</em>, not unnaturally, might seem to himself
		the greatest of all men that had been in the world for some
		ages.</p>

		<p>But at this point the fatal charlatan-element got the upper-hand. He
		apostatized from his old faith in facts, took to believing in semblances;
		strove to connect himself with Austrian dynasties, popedoms, with the
		old false feudalities which he once saw clearly to be false; considered
		that <em>he</em> would found &#8216;his dynasty&#8217; and so forth; that the enormous
		French revolution meant only that! The man was &#8216;given up to strong
		delusion that he should believe a lie;&#8217; a fearful but most sure thing.
		He did not know true from false now when he looked at them; the fearfulest
		penalty a man pays for yielding to untruth of heart. <em>Self</em> and
		false ambition had now become his god: <em>self</em>-deception once yielded to,
		<em>all</em> other deceptions follow naturally, more and more. What a paltry
		patch-work of theatrical paper-mantles, tinsel and mummery, had this
		man wrapped his own reality in, thinking to make it more real thereby!
		His hollow Pope&#8217;s-Concordat, pretending to be a reëstablishment of Catholicism,
		felt by himself to be the method of extirpating it, &#8216;<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la vaccine de
		la religion</em>;&#8217; his ceremonial coronations, consecrations by the old Italian
		<a class="pagenum" id="page416" title="416"></a>chimera in Notre Dame there; &#8216;wanting nothing to complete the pomp
		of it but the half million who had died to put an end to all that!&#8217; Cromwell&#8217;s
		inauguration was by the sword and Bible; what we must call a
		genuinely <em>true</em> one. Sword and Bible were borne before him, without
		any chimera. Were not these real emblems of Puritanism; its true
		decoration and insignia? It had used them both in a very real manner,
		and pretended to stand by them now! But this poor Napoleon mistook;
		he believed too much in the <em>dupeability</em> of men; saw no fact
		deeper in man than hunger and this. He was mistaken. Like a
		man that should build upon cloud; his house and he falls down in confused
		wreck, and depart out of the world.</p>

		<p>Alas! in all of us this charlatan-element exists; and might be
		developed, were the temptation strong enough. &#8216;Lead us not into temptation!&#8217;
		But it is fatal, I say, that it <em>be</em> developed. The thing into which
		it enters as a cognizable ingredient is doomed to be altogether transitory;
		and, however huge it may <em>look</em>, is in itself small. Napoleon&#8217;s
		working, accordingly, what was it with all the noise it made? A flash
		as of gunpowder wide spread; a blazing up as of dry heath. For an
		hour the whole universe seems wrapt in smoke and flame; but only for
		an hour. It goes out. The universe, with its old mountains and
		streams, its stars above and kind soil beneath, is still there.</p>

		<p>The Duke of Weimar told his friends always to be of courage; this
		Napoleonism was unjust, a falsehood, and could not last. It is true
		doctrine. The heavier this Napoleon trampled on the world, holding it
		tyrannously down, the fiercer would the world&#8217;s recoil against him be,
		one day. Injustice pays itself with frightful compound interest. I am
		not sure but he had better lost his best park of artillery, or had his best
		regiment drowned in the sea, than shot that poor German bookseller,
		Palm! It was a palpable, tyrannous, murderous injustice, which no man,
		let him paint an inch thick, could make out to be other. It burnt deep
		into the hearts of men, it and the like of it; suppressed fire flashed in
		the eyes of men, as they thought of it, waiting their day! Which day
		<em>came</em>: Germany rose round him. What Napoleon <em>did</em> will amount in
		the long run to what he did <em>justly</em>; what Nature with her laws will
		sanction. To what of reality was in him; to that and nothing more.
		The rest was all smoke and waste. <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La carrière ouverte aux talens:</em>
		that great true message, which has yet to articulate and fulfil itself
		every where, he left in a most inarticulate state. He was a great
		<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ébauche</em>, rude-draught; as indeed what great man is not? Left in too
		rude a state, alas!</p>

		<p>His notions of the world, as he expresses them there at St. Helena,
		are almost tragical to consider. He seems to feel the most unaffected
		surprise that it has all gone so; that he is flung out on the rock here,
		and the world is still moving on its axis. France is great, and all great;
		and at bottom, he is France. England itself he says is by nature only
		an appendage of France; &#8216;another isle of Oberon to France.&#8217; So it
		was <em>by nature</em>, by Napoleon-nature; and yet look how in fact&#8212;<strong class="special_emphasis">here
		am I</strong>! He cannot understand it; that France was not all great, that he
		was not France. &#8216;Strong delusion,&#8217; that he should believe the thing to
		be which <em>is</em> not! The compact, clear-seeing, decisive Italian nature of
		<a class="pagenum" id="page417" title="417"></a>him, strong, genuine, which he once had, has enveloped itself, half dissolved
		itself, in a turbid atmosphere of French fanfaronade. The world
		was not disposed to be trodden down under foot; to be bound into masses,
		and built together as <em>he</em> liked, for a pedestal for France and him: the
		world has quite other purposes in view! Napoleon&#8217;s astonishment is
		extreme. But alas, what help now! He had gone that way of his; and
		Nature had also gone her way. Having once parted with reality, he
		tumbles helpless in vacuity; no rescue for him. He had to sink there
		mournfully as man seldom did; and break his great heart and die&#8212;this
		poor Napoleon; a great implement too soon wasted, till it was useless;
		our last Great Man!</p>

		<h2 class="title"><a class="pagenum" id="page418" title="418"></a>THE LEGEND OF DON RODERICK.</h2>

		<p class="chapter_title">NUMBER THREE.</p>

		<p><span class="first_word">The</span> scattered fugitives of the Christian army spread terror throughout
		the land. The inhabitants of the towns and villages gathered around
		them as they applied at their gates for food, or laid themselves down,
		faint and wounded, beside the public fountains. When they related the
		tale of their defeat, old men shook their heads and groaned, and the
		women uttered cries and lamentations. So strange and unlooked-for a
		calamity filled them with consternation and despair; for it was long
		since the alarm of war had sounded in their land: and this was a warfare
		that carried chains and slavery, and all kinds of horrors, in its
		train.</p>

		<p>Don Roderick was seated with his beauteous queen, Exilona, in the
		royal palace which crowned the rocky summit of Toledo, when the
		bearer of ill-tidings came galloping over the bridge of the Tagus.
		&#8216;What tidings from the army?&#8217; demanded the king, as the panting
		messenger was brought into his presence. &#8216;Tidings of great wo!&#8217;
		exclaimed the soldier. &#8216;The prince has fallen in battle. I saw his
		head and surcoat upon a Moorish lance; and the army was overthrown
		and fled!&#8217;</p>

		<p>At hearing these words, Roderick covered his face with his hands,
		and for some time sat in silence; and all his courtiers stood mute and
		aghast, and no one dared to speak a word. In that awful space of time
		passed before his thoughts all his errors and his crimes, and all the evil
		that had been predicted in the necromantic tower. His mind was filled
		with horror and confusion, for the hour of his destruction seemed at
		hand: but he subdued his agitation by his strong and haughty spirit;
		and, when he uncovered his face, no one could read on his brow the
		trouble and agony of his heart. Still, every hour brought fresh tidings
		of disaster. Messenger after messenger came spurring into the city,
		distracting it with new alarms. The infidels, they said, were strengthening
		themselves in the land; host after host were pouring in from
		Africa: the sea-coast of Andalusia glittered with spears and scimitars.
		Bands of turbaned horsemen had overrun the plains of Sidonia, even
		to the banks of the Guadiana. Fields were laid waste, towns and cities
		plundered, the inhabitants carried into captivity, and the whole country
		lay in smoking desolation.</p>

		<p>Roderick heard all these tidings with an undaunted aspect; nor did
		he ever again betray sign of consternation: but the anxiety of his soul
		was evident in his warlike preparations. He issued orders that every
		noble and prelate of his kingdom should put himself at the head of his
		retainers, and take the field; and that every man capable of bearing
		arms should hasten to his standard, bringing whatever horse, and mule,
		and weapon he possessed: and he appointed the plain of Cordova for
		the place where the army was to assemble. Throwing by, then, all the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page419" title="419"></a>trappings of his late slothful and voluptuous life, and arming himself for
		warlike action, he departed from Toledo at the head of his guard, composed
		of the flower of the youthful nobility. His queen, Exilona,
		accompanied him; for she craved permission to remain in one of the
		cities of Andalusia, that she might be near her lord in this time of peril.</p>

		<p>Among the first who appeared to hail the arrival of the king at Cordova,
		was the Bishop Oppas, the secret partisan of the traitor Julian.
		He brought with him his two nephews, Evan and Siseburto, the sons of
		the late king Witiza; and a great host of vassals and retainers, all well
		armed and appointed, for they had been furnished, by Count Julian,
		with a part of the arms sent by the king to Africa. The bishop was
		smooth of tongue, and profound in his hypocrisy: his pretended zeal
		and devotion, and the horror with which he spoke of the treachery of
		his kinsman, imposed upon the credulous spirit of the king, and he was
		readily admitted into his most secret council.</p>

		<p>The alarm of the infidel invasion had spread throughout the land, and
		roused the Gothic valor of the inhabitants. On receiving the orders of
		Roderick, every town and hamlet, every mountain and valley, had sent
		forth its fighting men, and the whole country was on the march toward
		Andalusia. In a little while there were gathered together, on the plain
		of Cordova, near fifty thousand horsemen, and a countless host of foot-soldiers.
		The Gothic nobles appeared in burnished armor, curiously
		inlaid, and adorned with chains and jewels of gold, and ornaments of
		precious stones, and silken scarfs, and surcoats of brocade, or velvet
		richly embroidered; betraying the luxury and ostentation with which
		they had declined from the iron hardihood of their warlike sires. As to
		the common people, some had lances and shields and swords and crossbows,
		but the greater part were unarmed, or provided merely with slings,
		and clubs studded with nails, and with the iron implements of husbandry;
		and many had made shields for themselves from the doors and windows
		of their habitations. They were a prodigious host, and appeared, say
		the Arabian chroniclers, like an agitated sea; but, though brave in
		spirit, they possessed no knowledge of warlike art, and were ineffectual
		through lack of arms and discipline.</p>

		<p>Several of the most ancient and experienced cavaliers, beholding the
		state of the army, advised Don Roderick to await the arrival of more
		regular troops, which were stationed in Iberia, Cantabria, and Gallia
		Gothica; but this counsel was strenuously opposed by the Bishop Oppas;
		who urged the king to march immediately against the infidels. &#8216;As
		yet,&#8217; said he, &#8216;their number is but limited; but every day new hosts
		arrive, like flocks of locusts, from Africa. They will augment faster
		than we; they are living, too, at our expense, and, while we pause, both
		armies are consuming the substance of the land.&#8217;</p>

		<p>King Roderick listened to the crafty counsel of the bishop, and determined
		to advance without delay. He mounted his war horse, Orelia,
		and rode among his troops assembled on that spacious plain, and wherever
		he appeared he was received with acclamations; for nothing so
		arouses the spirit of the soldier as to behold his sovereign in arms. He
		addressed them in words calculated to touch their hearts and animate
		their courage. &#8216;The Saracens,&#8217; said he, &#8216;are ravaging our land, and
		<a class="pagenum" id="page420" title="420"></a>their object is our conquest. Should they prevail, your very existence
		as a nation is at an end. They will overturn your altars; trample on
		the cross; lay waste your cities; carry off your wives and daughters,
		and doom yourselves and sons to hard and cruel slavery. No safety
		remains for you but in the prowess of your arms. For my own part,
		as I am your king, so will I be your leader, and will be the foremost to
		encounter every toil and danger.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The soldiery answered their monarch with loud acclamations, and
		solemnly pledged themselves to fight to the last gasp in defence of their
		country and their faith. The king then arranged the order of their
		march: all those who were armed with cuirasses and coats of mail were
		placed in the front and rear; the centre of the army was composed of
		a promiscuous throng, without body armor, and but scantily provided
		with weapons.</p>

		<p>When they were about to march, the king called to him a noble
		cavalier named Ramiro, and delivering him the royal standard, charged
		him to guard it well for the honor of Spain; scarcely, however, had
		the good knight received it in his hand, when he fell dead from his horse,
		and the staff of the standard was broken in twain. Many ancient courtiers
		who were present looked upon this as an evil omen, and counselled
		the king not to set forward on his march that day; but, disregarding all
		auguries and portents, he ordered the royal banner to be put upon a
		lance, and gave it in charge of another standard-bearer; then commanding
		the trumpets to be sounded, he departed at the head of his host
		to seek the enemy.</p>

		<p>The field where this great army assembled was called, from the
		solemn pledge given by the nobles and the soldiery, <em lang="es" xml:lang="es">El campo de la
		verdad</em>; or, The field of Truth; a name, says the sage chronicler Abul
		Cassim, which it bears even to the present day.</p>

		<p>The hopes of Andalusia revived, as this mighty host stretched in
		lengthened lines along its fertile plains; from morning until night it continued
		to pour along, with sound of drum and trumpet; it was led on
		by the proudest nobles and bravest cavaliers of the land, and, had it
		possessed arms and discipline, might have undertaken the conquest of
		the world.</p>

		<p>After a few days&#8217; march, Don Roderick arrived in sight of the Moslem
		army, encamped on the banks of the Guadalete, where that beautiful
		stream winds through the fertile land of Xeres. The infidel host was
		far inferior in number to the Christians; but then it was composed of
		hardy and dexterous troops, seasoned to war, and admirably armed.
		The camp shone gloriously in the setting sun, and resounded with the
		clash of cymbal, the note of the trumpet, and the neighing of fiery Arabian
		steeds. There were swarthy troops from every nation of the
		African coast, together with legions from Syria and Egypt, while the
		light Bedouins were careering about the adjacent plain. What grieved
		and incensed the spirits of the Christian warriors, however, was to behold,
		a little apart from the Moslem host, an encampment of Spanish
		cavaliers, with the banner of Count Julian waving above their tents.
		They were ten thousand in number, valiant and hardy men, the most
		experienced of Spanish soldiery, most of them having served in the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page421" title="421"></a>African wars; they were well armed and appointed also, with the
		weapons of which the count had beguiled his sovereign; and it was a
		grievous sight to behold such good soldiers arrayed against their country
		and their faith.</p>

		<p>The Christians pitched their tents about the hour of vespers, at a short
		league distant from the enemy, and remained gazing with anxiety and
		awe upon this barbaric host that had caused such terror and desolation
		in the land: for the first sight of a hostile encampment in a country
		disused to war, is terrible to the newly enlisted soldier. A marvellous
		occurrence is recorded by the Arabian chroniclers as having taken
		place in the Christian camp; but discreet Spanish writers relate it with
		much modification, and consider it a stratagem of the wily Bishop
		Oppas, to sound the loyalty of the Christian cavaliers.</p>

		<p>As several leaders of the army were seated with the bishop in his
		tent, conversing on the dubious fortunes of the approaching contest, an
		ancient pilgrim appeared at the entrance. He was bowed down with
		years, his snowy beard descended to his girdle, and he supported his
		tottering steps with a palmer&#8217;s staff. The cavaliers rose and received
		him with great reverence as he advanced within the tent. Holding up
		his withered hand, &#8216;Wo, wo to Spain!&#8217; exclaimed he, &#8216;for the vial of
		the wrath of heaven is about to be poured out. Listen, warriors, and
		take warning. Four months since, having performed my pilgrimage to
		the sepulchre of our Lord in Palestine, I was on my return toward my
		native land. Wearied and wayworn, I lay down one night to sleep beneath
		a palm tree, by the side of a fountain, when I was awakened by
		a voice saying unto me, in soft accents, &#8216;Son of sorrow, why sleepest
		thou?&#8217; I opened my eyes, and beheld one of a fair and beauteous
		countenance, in shining apparel and with glorious wings, standing by
		the fountain; and I said, &#8216;Who art thou who callest upon me in this
		deep hour of the night?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;&#8216;Fear not,&#8217; replied the stranger, &#8216;I am an angel from heaven, sent
		to reveal unto thee the fate of thy country. Behold the sins of Roderick
		have come up before God, and his anger is kindled against him, and he
		has given him up to be invaded and destroyed. Hasten then to Spain, and
		seek the camp of thy countrymen. Warn them that such only shall
		be saved as shall abandon Roderick; but those who adhere to him shall
		share his punishment, and shall fall under the sword of the invader.&#8217;&#8217;</p>

		<p>The pilgrim ceased, and passed forth from the tent; certain of the
		cavaliers followed him to detain him, that they might converse further
		with him about these matters, but he was no where to be found. The
		sentinel before the tent said, &#8216;I saw no one come forth, but it was as if
		a blast of wind passed by me, and there was a rustling as of dry
		leaves.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The cavaliers remained looking upon each other with astonishment.
		The Bishop Oppas sat with his eyes fixed upon the ground, and shadowed
		by his overhanging brow. At length, breaking silence, in a low
		and faltering voice, &#8216;Doubtless,&#8217; said he, &#8216;this message is from God;
		and since he has taken compassion upon us, and given us notice of his
		impending judgment, it behooves us to hold grave council, and determine
		how best we may accomplish his will and avert his displeasure.&#8217;</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page422" title="422"></a>The chiefs still remained silent, as men confounded. Among them
		was a veteran noble named Pelistes. He had distinguished himself in
		the African wars, fighting side by side with Count Julian, but the latter
		had never dared to tamper with his faith, for he knew his stern integrity.
		Pelistes had brought with him to the camp his only son, who had
		never drawn a sword except in tourney. When the young man saw
		that the veterans held their peace, the blood mantled in his cheek, and,
		overcoming his modesty, he broke forth with a generous warmth: &#8216;I
		know not, cavaliers,&#8217; said he, &#8216;what is passing in your minds, but I believe
		this pilgrim to be an envoy from the devil; for none else could
		have given such dastard and perfidious counsel. For my own part, I
		stand ready to defend my king, my country, and my faith. I know no
		higher duty than this, and if God thinks fit to strike me dead in the
		performance of it, his sovereign will be done!&#8217;</p>

		<p>When the young man had risen to speak, his father had fixed his eyes
		upon him with a grave and stern demeanor, leaning upon a two-handed
		sword. As soon as the youth had finished, Pelistes embraced him with
		a father&#8217;s fondness. &#8216;Thou hast spoken well, my son,&#8217; said he; &#8216;if I
		held my peace at the counsel of this losel pilgrim, it was but to hear
		thy opinion, and to learn whether thou wert worthy of thy lineage and
		of the training I had given thee. Hadst thou counselled otherwise than
		thou hast done, hadst thou shown thyself craven and disloyal, so help me
		God, I would have struck off thy head with this weapon which I hold
		in my hand. But thou hast counselled like a loyal and a Christian
		knight, and I thank God for having given me a son worthy to perpetuate
		the honors of my line. As to this pilgrim, be he saint or be he devil, I
		care not; this much I promise, that if I am to die in defence of my
		country and my king, my life shall be a costly purchase to the foe.
		Let each man make the same resolve, and I trust we shall yet prove
		the pilgrim a lying prophet.&#8217; The words of Pelistes roused the spirits
		of many of the cavaliers; others, however, remained full of anxious
		foreboding, and when this fearful prophecy was rumored about the
		camp, as it presently was by the emissaries of the bishop, it spread awe
		and dismay among the soldiery.</p>

		<p>On the following day, the two armies remained regarding each other
		with wary but menacing aspect. About noontide, King Roderick sent
		forth a chosen force of five hundred horse and two hundred foot, the
		best armed of his host, to skirmish with the enemy, that, by gaining
		some partial advantage, they might raise the spirits of the army. They
		were led on by Theodomir, the same Gothic noble who had signalised
		himself by first opposing the invasion of the Moslems.</p>

		<p>The Christian squadrons paraded with flying pennons in the valley
		which lay between the armies. The Arabs were not slow in answering
		their defiance. A large body of horsemen sallied forth to the encounter,
		together with three hundred of the followers of Count Julian. There
		was hot skirmishing about the field, and on the banks of the river; many
		gallant feats were displayed on either side, and many valiant warriors
		were slain. As the night closed in, the trumpets from either camp summoned
		the troops to retire from the combat. In this day&#8217;s action the
		Christians suffered greatly in the loss of their distinguished cavaliers;
		<a class="pagenum" id="page423" title="423"></a>for it is the noblest spirits who venture most, and lay themselves open
		to danger; and the Moslem soldiers had instructions to single out the
		leaders of the adverse host. All this is said to have been devised by
		the perfidious Bishop Oppas, who had secret communications with the
		enemy, while he influenced the councils of the king; and who trusted
		that by this skirmishing warfare the power of the Christian troops would
		be cut off, and the rest disheartened.</p>

		<p>On the following morning, a larger force was ordered out to skirmish,
		and such of the soldiery as were unarmed were commanded to stand
		ready to seize the horses and strip off the armor of the killed and wounded.
		Among the most illustrious of the warriors who fought that day was
		Pelistes, the Gothic noble who had sternly checked the tongue of the
		Bishop Oppas. He led to the field a large body of his own vassals and
		retainers, and of cavaliers trained up in his house, who had followed
		him to the wars in Africa, and who looked up to him more as a father
		than a chieftain. Beside him was his only son, who now for the first time
		was fleshing his sword in battle. The conflict that day was more general
		and bloody than the day preceding; the slaughter of the Christian
		warriors was immense, from their lack of defensive armour; and as
		nothing could prevent the flower of the Gothic chivalry from spurring
		to the combat, the field was strewed with the bodies of the youthful nobles.
		None suffered more, however, than the warriors of Pelistes. Their
		leader himself was bold and hardy, and prone to expose himself to danger;
		but years and experience had moderated his early fire; his son,
		however, was eager to distinguish himself in this, his first essay, and
		rushed with impetuous ardor into the hottest of the battle. In vain his
		father called to caution him; he was ever in the advance, and seemed
		unconscious of the perils that surrounded him. The cavaliers and vassals
		of his father followed him with devoted zeal, and many of them
		paid for their loyalty with their lives. When the trumpet sounded in
		the evening for retreat, the troops of Pelistes were the last to reach the
		camp. They came slowly and mournfully, and much decreased in
		number. Their veteran commander was seated on his war-horse, but
		the blood trickled from the greaves of his armour. His valiant son
		was borne on the shields of his vassals; when they laid him on the
		earth near to where the king was standing, they found that the heroic
		youth had expired of his wounds. The cavaliers surrounded the body
		and gave utterance to their grief; but the father restrained his agony,
		and looked on with the stern resignation of a soldier.</p>

		<p>Don Roderick surveyed the field of battle with a rueful eye, for it
		was covered with the mangled bodies of his most illustrious warriors;
		he saw, too, with anxiety, that the common people, unused to war, and
		unsustained by discipline, were harassed by incessant toils and dangers,
		and were cooling in their zeal and courage.</p>

		<p>The crafty Bishop Oppas marked the internal trouble of the king, and
		thought a favorable moment had arrived to sway him to his purpose.
		He called to his mind the various portents and prophecies which had
		forerun their present danger. &#8216;Let not my lord the king,&#8217; said he,
		&#8216;make light of these mysterious revelations, which appear to be so disastrously
		fulfilling. The hand of Heaven appears to be against us.
		<a class="pagenum" id="page424" title="424"></a>Destruction is impending over our heads. Our troops are rude and
		unskilful, but slightly armed, and much cast down in spirit. Better is
		it that we should make a treaty with the enemy, and, by granting part
		of his demands, prevent the utter ruin of our country. If such counsel
		be acceptable to my lord the king, I stand ready to depart upon an
		embassy to the Moslem camp.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Upon hearing these words, Pelistes, who had stood in mournful silence,
		regarding the dead body of his son, burst forth with honest indignation.
		&#8216;By this good sword,&#8217; said he, &#8216;the man who yields such dastard counsel
		deserves death from the hand of his countrymen rather than from
		the foe; and, were it not for the presence of the king, may I forfeit salvation
		if I would not strike him dead upon the spot.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The bishop turned an eye of venom upon Pelistes. &#8216;My lord,&#8217; said
		he, &#8216;I too, bear a weapon, and know how to wield it. Were the king
		not present you would not dare to menace, nor should you advance one
		step without my hastening to meet you.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The king interposed between the jarring nobles, and rebuked the impetuosity
		of Pelistes, but at the same time rejected the counsel of the
		bishop. &#8216;The event of this conflict,&#8217; said he, &#8216;is in the hand of God;
		but never shall my sword return to its scabbard while an infidel invader
		remains within the land.&#8217;</p>

		<p>He then held a council with his captains, and it was determined to
		offer the enemy general battle on the following day. A herald was
		despatched defying Taric ben Zeyad to the contest, and the defiance was
		gladly accepted by the Moslem chieftain. Don Roderick then formed
		the plan of action, and assigned to each commander his several station,
		after which he dismissed his officers, and each one sought his tent, to
		prepare by diligence or repose for the next day&#8217;s eventful contest.</p>

		<p>Taric ben Zeyad had been surprised by the valor of the Christian
		cavaliers in the recent battles, and at the number and apparent devotion
		of the troops which accompanied the king to the field. The confident
		defiance of Don Roderick increased his surprise. When the herald
		had retired, he turned an eye of suspicion on Count Julian. &#8216;Thou
		hast represented thy countrymen,&#8217; said he, &#8216;as sunk in effeminacy and
		lost to all generous impulse: yet I find them fighting with the courage
		and the strength of lions. Thou hast represented thy king as detested
		by his subjects, and surrounded by secret treason, but I behold his tents
		whitening the hills and dales, while thousands are hourly flocking to
		his standard. Wo unto thee if thou hast dealt deceitfully with us, or
		betrayed us with guileful words.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Don Julian retired to his tent in great trouble of mind, and fear came
		upon him that the Bishop Oppas might play him false; for it is the lot
		of traitors ever to distrust each other. He called to him the same page
		who had brought him the letter from Florinda, revealing the story of
		her dishonor.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Thou knowest, my trusty page,&#8217; said he, &#8216;that I have reared thee in
		my household, and cherished thee above all thy companions. If thou
		hast loyalty and affection for thy lord, now is the time to serve him.
		Hie thee to the Christian camp, and find thy way to the tent of the
		Bishop Oppas. If any one ask thee who thou art, tell them thou art of
		<a class="pagenum" id="page425" title="425"></a>the household of the bishop, and bearer of missives from Cordova.
		When thou art admitted to the presence of the bishop, show him this ring,
		and he will commune with thee in secret. Then tell him Count Julian
		greets him as a brother, and demands how the wrongs of his daughter
		Florinda are to be redressed. Mark well his reply, and bring it word
		for word. Have thy lips closed, but thine eyes and ears open; and
		observe every thing of note in the camp of the king. So speed thee on
		thy errand&#8212;away, away!&#8217;</p>

		<p>The page hastened to saddle a Barbary steed, fleet as the wind, and
		of a jet black color, so as not to be easily discernible in the night. He
		girded on a sword and dagger, slung an Arab bow with a quiver of
		arrows at his side, and a buckler at his shoulder. Issuing out of the
		camp, he sought the banks of the Guadalete, and proceeded silently
		along its stream, which reflected the distant fires of the Christian camp.
		As he passed by the place which had been the scene of the recent conflict,
		he heard, from time to time, the groan of some expiring warrior
		who had crawled among the reeds on the margin of the river; and
		sometimes his steed stepped cautiously over the mangled bodies of the
		slain. The young page was unused to the sights of war, and his heart
		beat quick within him. He was hailed by the sentinels as he approached
		the Christian camp, and, on giving the reply taught him by Count Julian,
		was conducted to the tent of the Bishop Oppas.</p>

		<p>The bishop had not yet retired to his couch. When he beheld the
		ring of Count Julian, and heard the words of his message, he saw that
		the page was one in whom he might confide. &#8216;Hasten back to thy lord,&#8217;
		said he, &#8216;and tell him to have faith in me, and all shall go well. As
		yet I have kept my troops out of the combat. They are all fresh, well
		armed, and well appointed. The king has confided to myself, aided by
		the princes Evan and Siseburto, the command of a wing of the army.
		To-morrow, at the hour of noon, when both armies are in the heat of
		action, we will pass over with our forces to the Moslems. But I claim
		the compact made with Taric ben Zeyad, that my nephews be placed in
		dominion over Spain, and tributary only to the Caliph of Damascus.&#8217;
		With this traitorous message the page departed. He led his black steed
		by the bridle to present less mark for observation, as he went stumbling
		along near the expiring fires of the camp. On passing the last outpost,
		when the guards were half slumbering on their arms, he was overheard
		and summoned, but leaped lightly into the saddle and put spurs to his
		steed. An arrow whistled by his ear and two more stuck in the target
		which he had thrown upon his back. The clatter of swift hoofs echoed
		behind him, but he had learnt of the Arabs to fight and fly. Plucking a
		shaft from his quiver, and turning and rising in the stirrups as his
		courser galloped at full speed, he drew the arrow to the head and launched
		it at his pursuer. The twang of the bow-string was followed by the
		crash of armour, and a deep groan, as the horseman tumbled to the
		earth. The page pursued his course with further molestation, and arrived
		at the Moslem camp before the break of day.</p>

		<p>A light had burned throughout the night in the tent of the king, and
		anxious thoughts and dismal visions troubled his repose. If he fell into
		a slumber, he beheld in his dreams the shadowy phantoms of the necromantic
		<a class="pagenum" id="page426" title="426"></a>tower, or the injured Florinda, pale and dishevelled, imprecating
		the vengeance of Heaven upon his head. In the mid-watches of the
		night, when all was silent except the footstep of the sentinel, pacing before
		his tent, the king rose from his couch, and walking forth looked
		thoughtfully upon the martial scene before him. The pale crescent of
		the moon hung over the Moorish camp, and dimly lighted up the windings
		of the Guadalete. The heart of the king was heavy and oppressed;
		but he felt only for himself, says Antonio Agapida, he thought nothing
		of the perils impending over the thousands of devoted subjects in the
		camp below him; sleeping, as it were, on the margin of their graves.
		The faint clatter of distant hoofs, as if in rapid flight, reached the monarch&#8217;s
		ear, but the horsemen were not to be descried. At that very
		hour, and along the shadowy banks of that river, here and there gleaming
		with the scanty moonlight, passed the fugitive messenger of Count
		Julian, with the plan of the next day&#8217;s treason.</p>

		<p>The day had not yet dawned, when the sleepless and impatient monarch
		summoned his attendants and arrayed himself for the field. He then
		sent for the venerable Bishop Urbino, who had accompanied him to the
		camp, and, laying aside his regal crown, he knelt with head uncovered,
		and confessed his sins before the holy man. After this a solemn mass
		was performed in the royal tent, and the eucharist administered to the
		monarch. When these ceremonies were concluded, he besought the
		archbishop to depart forthwith for Cordova, there to await the issue of the
		battle, and to be ready to bring forward reinforcements and supplies.
		The archbishop saddled his mule and departed just as the faint blush of
		morning began to kindle in the east. Already the camp resounded with
		the thrilling call of the trumpet, the clank of armor, and the tramp
		and neigh of steeds. As the archbishop passed through the camp, he
		looked with a compassionate heart on this vast multitude, of whom so
		many were soon to perish. The warriors pressed to kiss his hand, and
		many a cavalier full of youth and fire received his benediction, who
		was to lie stiff and cold before the evening.</p>

		<p>When the troops were marshalled for the field, Don Roderick prepared
		to sally forth in the state and pomp with which the Gothic kings
		were wont to go to battle. He was arrayed in robes of gold brocade;
		his sandals were embroidered with pearls and diamonds; he had a sceptre
		in his hand, and he wore a regal crown resplendent with inestimable
		jewels. Thus gorgeously apparelled, he ascended a lofty chariot of
		ivory, the axle-trees of which were of silver, and the wheels and pole
		covered with plates of burnished gold. Above his head was a canopy
		of cloth of gold embossed with armorial devices, and studded with precious
		stones. This sumptuous chariot was drawn by milk-white horses,
		with caparisons of crimson velvet, embroidered with pearls. A thousand
		youthful cavaliers surrounded the car; all of the noblest blood and
		bravest spirit; all knighted by the king&#8217;s own hand, and sworn to defend
		him to the last.</p>

		<p>When Roderick issued forth in this resplendent state, says an Arabian
		writer, surrounded by his guards in gilded armour and waving plumes
		and scarfs and surcoats of a thousand dyes, it was as if the sun were
		<a class="pagenum" id="page427" title="427"></a>emerging in the dazzling chariot of the day from amidst the glorious
		clouds of morning.</p>

		<p>As the royal car rolled along in front of the squadrons, the soldiers
		shouted with admiration. Don Roderick waved his sceptre, and addressed
		them from his lofty throne, reminding them of the horror and
		desolation which had already been spread through the land by the invaders.
		He called upon them to summon up the ancient valor of their
		race, and avenge the blood of their brethren. &#8216;One day of glorious
		fighting,&#8217; said he, &#8216;and this infidel horde will be driven into the sea, or
		will perish beneath your swords. Forward bravely to the fight; your
		families are behind you praying for your success; the invaders of your
		country are before you; God is above to bless his holy cause, and your
		king leads you to the field.&#8217; The army shouted with one accord, &#8216;Forward
		to the foe, and death be his portion who shuns the encounter!&#8217;</p>

		<p>The rising sun began to shine along the glistening waters of the
		Guadalete as the Moorish army, squadron after squadron, came sweeping
		down a gentle declivity to the sound of martial music. Their turbans
		and robes, of various dyes and fashions, gave a splendid appearance
		to their host; as they marched, a cloud of dust arose and partly hid
		them from the sight, but still there would break forth flashes of steel
		and gleams of burnished gold, like rays of vivid lightning, while the
		sound of drum and trumpet, and the clash of Moorish cymbal, were as
		the warlike thunder within that stormy cloud of battle.</p>

		<p>As the armies drew near each other the sun disappeared among gathering
		clouds, and the gloom of the day was increased by the columns of
		dust which rose from either host. At length the trumpet sounded for
		the encounter. The battle commenced with showers of arrows, stones,
		and javelins. The Christian foot-soldiers fought to disadvantage, the
		greater part being destitute of helm or buckler. A battalion of light
		Arabian horsemen, led by a Greek renegado named Magued el Rumi,
		careered in front of the Christian line, launching their darts, and then
		wheeling off beyond the reach of the missiles hurled after them. Theodomir
		now brought up his seasoned troops into the action, seconded by
		the veteran Pelistes, and in a little while the battle became furious and
		promiscuous. It was glorious to behold the old Gothic valor shining
		forth in this hour of fearful trial. Wherever the Moslems fell, the
		Christians rushed forward, seized upon their horses, and stripped them
		of their armour and their weapons. They fought desperately and successfully,
		for they fought for their country and their faith. The battle
		raged for several hours; the field was strown with slain, and the Moors,
		overcome by the multitude and fury of their foes, began to falter.</p>

		<p>When Taric beheld his troops retreating before the enemy, he threw
		himself before them, and, rising in his stirrups, &#8216;Oh, Moslems! conquerors
		of Africa!&#8217; cried he, whither would you fly? The sea is behind
		you, the enemy before; you have no hope but in your valor and
		the help of God. Do as I do and the day is ours!&#8217;</p>

		<p>With these words he put spurs to his horse and sprang among the
		enemy, striking to right and left, cutting down and destroying, while his
		steed, fierce as himself, trampled upon the foot soldiers and tore them
		with his teeth. At this moment a mighty shout arose in various parts
		<a class="pagenum" id="page428" title="428"></a>of the field; the noontide hour had arrived. The Bishop Oppas with
		the two princes, who had hitherto kept their bands out of the fight, suddenly
		went over to the enemy, and turned their weapons upon their astonished
		countrymen. From that moment the fortune of the day was
		changed, and the field of battle became a scene of wild confusion and
		bloody massacre. The Christians knew not whom to contend with, or
		whom to trust. It seemed as if madness had seized upon their friends
		and kinsmen, and that their worst enemies were among themselves.</p>

		<p>The courage of Don Roderick rose with his danger. Throwing off
		the cumbrous robes of royalty, and descending from his car, he sprang
		upon his steed Orelia, grasped his lance and buckler, and endeavored
		to rally his retreating troops. He was surrounded and assailed by a
		multitude of his own traitorous subjects, but defended himself with wondrous
		prowess. The enemy thickened around him; his loyal band of
		cavaliers were slain, bravely fighting in his defence; the last that was
		seen of the king was in the midst of the enemy, dealing death at every
		blow.</p>

		<p>A complete panic fell upon the Christians; they threw away their
		arms and fled in all directions. They were pursued with dreadful
		slaughter, until the darkness of the night rendered it impossible to distinguish
		friend from foe. Taric then called off his troops from the pursuit,
		and took possession of the royal camp; and the couch which had
		been pressed so uneasily on the preceding night by Don Roderick, now
		yielded sound repose to his conqueror.</p>

		<p>On the morning after the battle, the Arab leader, Taric ben Zeyad,
		rode over the bloody field of the Gaudalete, strewed with the ruins of
		those splendid armies, which had so lately passed like glorious pageants
		along the river banks. There Moor and Christian, horseman and horse,
		lay gashed with hideous wounds; and the river, still red with blood,
		was filled with the bodies of the slain. The gaunt Arab was as a wolf
		roaming through the fold he had laid waste. On every side his eye
		revelled on the ruin of the country, on the wrecks of haughty Spain.
		There lay the flower of her youthful chivalry, mangled and destroyed,
		and the strength of her yeomanry prostrated in the dust. The Gothic
		noble lay confounded with his vassals; the peasant with the prince; all
		ranks and dignities were mingled in one bloody massacre.</p>

		<p>When Taric had surveyed the field, he caused the spoils of the dead
		and the plunder of the camp to be brought before him. The booty was
		immense. There were massy chains, and rare jewels of gold; pearls
		and precious stones; rich silks and brocades, and all other luxurious
		decorations in which the Gothic nobles had indulged in the latter times
		of their degeneracy. A vast amount of treasure was likewise found,
		which had been brought by Roderick for the expenses of the war.</p>

		<p>Taric then ordered that the bodies of the Moslem warriors should be
		interred; as for those of the Christians, they were gathered in heaps,
		and vast pyres of wood were formed, on which they were consumed.
		The flames of these pyres rose high in the air, and were seen afar off in
		the night; and when the Christians beheld them from the neighboring
		hills they beat their breasts and tore their hair, and lamented over them
		as over the funeral fires of their country. The carnage of that battle
		<a class="pagenum" id="page429" title="429"></a>infected the air for two whole months, and bones were seen lying in
		heaps upon the field for more than forty years; nay, when ages had past
		and gone, the husbandman, turning up the soil, would still find fragments
		of Gothic cuirasses and helms, and Moorish scimitars, the relics
		of that dreadful fight.</p>

		<p>For three days the Arabian horseman pursued the flying Christians,
		hunting them over the face of the country; so that but a scanty number
		of that mighty host escaped to tell the tale of their disaster.</p>

		<p>Taric ben Zeyad considered his victory incomplete so long as the
		Gothic monarch survived; he proclaimed great rewards, therefore, to
		whomsoever should bring Roderick to him, dead or alive. A diligent
		search was accordingly made in every direction, but for a long time in
		vain; at length a soldier brought to Taric the head of a Christian warrior,
		on which was a cap decorated with feathers and precious stones.
		The Arab leader received it as the head of the unfortunate Roderick,
		and sent it, as a trophy of his victory, to Musa ben Nosier, who, in like
		manner, transmitted it to the caliph at Damascus. The Spanish historians,
		however, have always denied its identity.</p>

		<p>A mystery has ever hung and ever must continue to hang, over the
		fate of King Roderick, in that dark and doleful day of Spain. Whether
		he went down amidst the storm of battle, and atoned for his sins and
		errors by a patriot grave, or whether he survived to repent of them in
		hermit exile, must remain matter of conjecture and dispute. The learned
		Archbishop Rodrigo, who has recorded the events of this disastrous
		field, affirms that Roderick fell beneath the vengeful blade of the traitor
		Julian, and thus expiated with his blood his crime against the hapless
		Florinda; but the archbishop stands alone in his record of the fact. It
		seems generally admitted that Orelia, the favorite war-horse of Don
		Roderick, was found entangled in a marsh on the borders of the Gaudalete,
		with the sandals and mantle and royal insignia of the king lying
		close by him. The river at this place ran broad and deep, and was encumbered
		with the dead bodies of warriors and steeds; it has been supposed
		therefore, that he perished in the stream; but his body was not
		found within its waters.</p>

		<p>When several years had passed away, and men&#8217;s minds, being restored
		to some degree of tranquillity, began to occupy themselves about
		the events of this dismal day, a rumor arose that Roderick had escaped
		from the carnage on the banks of the Gaudalete, and was still alive. It
		was said, that having from a rising ground caught a view of the whole
		field of battle, and seen that the day was lost, and his army flying in
		all directions, he likewise sought his safety in flight. It is added, that
		the Arab horsemen, while scouring the mountain in quest of fugitives,
		found a shepherd arrayed in the royal robes, and brought him before the
		conqueror, believing him to be the king himself. Count Julian soon dispelled
		the error. On being questioned, the trembling rustic declared
		that while tending his sheep in the folds of the mountains, there came a
		cavalier on a horse wearied and spent and ready to sink beneath the
		spur; that the cavalier with an authoritative voice and menacing air commanded
		him to exchange garments with him, and clad himself in his
		rude garb of sheep-skin, and took his crook and his scrip of provisions,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page430" title="430"></a>and continued up the rugged defiles of the mountains leading towards
		Castile, until he was lost to view.</p>

		<p>This tradition was fondly cherished by many, who clung to the belief
		in the existence of their monarch as their main hope for the redemption
		of Spain. It was even affirmed that he had taken refuge with many of
		his host, in an island of the &#8216;Ocean sea,&#8217; from whence he might yet return,
		once more to elevate his standard, and battle for the recovery of
		his throne.</p>

		<p>Year after year, however, elapsed and nothing was heard of Don
		Roderick; yet, like Sebastian of Portugal, and Arthur of England, his
		name continued to be a rallying point for popular faith, and the mystery
		of his end to give rise to romantic fables. At length, when generation
		after generation had sunk into the grave, and near two centuries had
		passed and gone, traces were said to be discovered that threw a light on
		the final fortunes of the unfortunate Roderick. At that time, Don Alphonso
		the Great, King of Leon, had wrested the city of Viseo in Lusitania
		from the hands of the Moslems. As his soldiers were ranging
		about the city and its environs, one of them discovered in a field, outside
		of the walls, a small chapel or hermitage, with a sepulchre in front,
		on which was inscribed this epitaph in Gothic characters:</p>

		<div class="epitaph">
			<p class="small_all_caps">HIC REQUIESCIT RUDERICUS,<br />
			  ULTIMUS REX GOTHORUM.</p>

			<p class="special_emphasis">Here Lies Roderick,<br />
			The last King of the Goths.</p>
		</div>

		<p>It has been believed by many that this was the veritable tomb of the
		monarch, and that in this hermitage he had finished his days in solitary
		penance. The warrior, as he contemplated the supposed tomb of the
		once haughty Roderick, forgot all his faults and errors, and shed a soldier&#8217;s
		tear over his memory; but when his thoughts turned to Count
		Julian, his patriotic indignation broke forth, and with his dagger he inscribed
		a rude malediction on the stone.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Accursed,&#8217; said he, &#8216;be the impious and headlong vengeance of the
		traitor Julian. He was a murderer of his king; a destroyer of his
		kindred; a betrayer of his country. May his name be bitter in every
		mouth, and his memory infamous to all generations.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Here ends the legend of Don Roderick.</p>

		<h2 class="title">A DREAM.</h2>


		<div class="epigram">
			<div class="poem">
				<p>This accident is not unlike my dream; belief of it</p>
				<p>Oppresses me already. <span class="source">Othello.</span></p>
			</div>
		</div>


		<p><span class="first_word">Upon</span> a certain clear and starry night of unbroken tranquility and
		peace, in the month of September, in the year of Grace one thousand
		eight hundred thirty and two; I, <span class="special_name">John Waters</span> of man&#8217;s Estate, Gentleman,
		dreamed a Dream. And lest I might be forced, like the great
		Babylonian monarch of yore, to say &#8216;the thing is gone from me,&#8217; I resolved
		while a vague remembrance yet rested in my thoughts, to record
		if possible some lasting memorial of it.</p>

		<p>Now, more than one half of the average number of years, assigned
		by computation to a generation of our race, have, since that point of
		time, rolled into the rearward hemisphere of Eternity; trials and
		changes, deep and stern and manifold, have rent and desolated this <em>house
		not made with hands</em>, and have exercised and broken the spirit that is
		supposed to be contained within it; yet the slight memorandum, written
		at that time, lies unchanged before me, and gives evidence of the comparatively
		impassible duration of inert matter over man; whose home,
		and whose abiding-place is not of earth!</p>

		<p>It is not that I can hope to describe my sensations of that night, in
		such a manner as to impart them to the contemplative spirit that may
		read this sketch, and to afford pleasure at all comparable with that which
		I enjoyed; but I have thought that I might by the recital awaken some
		gratifying recollections of still higher flittings of the imagination into
		the regions of unlimited Fancy; where the pleasure has been, as was
		mine, alike unbounded and pure.</p>

		<p>In an Existence like ours, where so much is ideal; where so many
		things are feared, that never come to pass; hoped for, that are never realized;
		enjoyed, that are impalpable to sense; where that, which by
		common convention is called substantial and real, is very far inferior
		to that which is falsely termed illusory and vain; where life borders on
		immortality; and the spiritual world so closely overhangs the natural,
		that it is as difficult to separate them as it is in Switzerland to know
		<a class="pagenum" id="page433" title="433"></a>which is Alps and which is Heaven;&#8212;there may oftentimes be much
		pleasure, perhaps some instruction, in a <span class="special_emphasis">Dream</span>.</p>

		<p>What should we say of dreams, if our eyes could but once have been
		opened upon the bright intellectual fancies, and anticipations; or upon
		the spiritual movements, of some of those by the side of whose supine and
		deserted forms it may have been our privilege to watch; but who, on
		waking into restored consciousness, remember not what they may have
		seen, or imagined, or may perhaps have accomplished, in their sleep?</p>

		<p>How often, within the compass of our own minds, do we not find
		thoughts and images that spring from sources that we cannot trace!
		Have we not more than once been called upon to perform some act of
		life, important to ourselves, or perchance to others; or been in some incidental
		circle of friends, or of persons who were strangers until then;
		or walked upon some lonely path in Europe&#8212;all for the first time as
		we suppose, and yet have we not had it irresistibly borne in upon our
		minds, that we have done all this before! signed the same paper in the
		same presence! heard the same voices speak the same words! noticed
		the same faces in the same positions! or recognized the mountains perhaps,
		and the trees, the landscape, the rocks, the very brook, as acquaintances
		of old; although the broad Atlantic had never yet been crossed
		by us before&#8212;except in spirit!</p>

		<p>Did you never in the day or night dream yourself to be upon some
		lofty overhanging precipice? did you never in imagination look down
		over its extreme verge upon the dark coast that skirts the foot of it, so
		far below you that you only distinguish the Rocks themselves by the
		white foam of the blue wave that breaks over them? Did you never
		hold by a bush while you were bending over this awful verge, listening
		to the low roar of the deep and distant waters, and perceive the Eagle
		itself soaring mid-way only up the cliff&#8212;and while you grew chill
		with the thoughts of depth, and danger, and distance from relief, did
		you never feel the bush give way and the gravel slide from beneath
		you, and the whole mass come thundering down from earth to ocean?</p>

		<p>One throb is given to madness and in the next you wake and find the
		body in security although perhaps in pain. Have you been in actual
		danger? do you believe that you have been? If not, why do you immediately
		pray to God and bless Him at such moments for his protection
		and care of you? Is it not that while the body has been quiescent,
		the excursive Soul has been in spiritual presence on the edge of
		that beetling and stupendous height?</p>

		<p>Suppose, as the mother sits beside the small bed, drinking with her eyes
		that draught of ecstatick pleasure which only Woman&#8217;s heart can taste,
		she could perceive the spirit of her boy, rising from the body that it
		leaves behind in roseate sleep, a thousand times more beautiful than it
		and yet the same; and still her own; and taking upon himself, as of
		his proper right, the grace and charm of &#8216;a young and rose-lipped cherub,&#8217;
		should chase, (and all within her sight,) the rainbow-butterflies of
		Paradise across its swards of velvet, and laugh in music to express his
		joy!</p>

		<p>Suppose that to the husband it should be given to behold his Wife&#8212;the
		pure in heart!&#8212;walking like a seraph in the Spiritual Life, as the earliest
		<a class="pagenum" id="page434" title="434"></a>light of morning moves along the hill-tops; her countenance &#8216;beautified
		with salvation&#8217; and joy unfolding itself at her approach: he sees
		and follows her as she enters into grottoes of shells, compared with which
		all flowers of Earth are mere attempts at colour! She listens to choirs
		of angels, joining worthily with them in the celestial chaunt! and when
		the hearts of both are elevated by the anthem strain, she kneels in solitude
		and prays for him in words that rise to Heaven, a grateful and
		accepted incense!</p>

		<p>Regard in silence those features of the young and beautiful upon the
		bed of slow consuming death; with what a grace do they not awake
		from the momentary trance of sleep! thoughts, not given to be revealed,
		have been garnered by that precious spirit as it hath soared upward toward
		the Heaven that is now bending with a summons unto everlasting
		Life! How gently yet how touchingly do not its glances and its last
		regrets pass through the diaphanous covering that remains to it of mortality,
		upon the friend who gazes in equal love and wonder at its side!
		how like the light within the vase! how sublimated the expression! how
		intent, how occupied that long look! how effulgent that passage of hope!
		how intimate, how exalted must have been the communion, when gleams
		of Faith and Joy, too beautiful for utterance, indicate the redeemed soul
		just fluttering to ascend in &#8216;robes made white in the blood of the
		Lamb!&#8217;</p>

		<p>Are not these and such as these, imaginations, communions, capacities,
		employments of the soul in Dreams? Ah! if what is called the
		Sleep of Death be mysterious, be awful, be sublime, be beautiful at
		times; how much more so,&#8212;when the form lies waiting to be revivified
		by the quick return of the excursive spirit,&#8212;how much more so is the
		Sleep of Life!</p>

		<p>I was lying in my bed, in a deep delicious repose, in my own bed,
		without either care, or cold, or gout, to molest me even in my dreams;
		I had been occupied during the evening with some elementary algebraical
		processes in the company of my dear son who was to prepare them
		for examination at school on the following day and who had succeeded
		in arriving at correct results, had copied off his work, and packed it in
		his satchel for the morning.</p>

		<p>Methought, while I slept, my son and I stood together hand in hand in
		the Church where we were accustomed to worship. We were very
		near the altar, but with our faces directed toward the organ and front
		gallery. There is in my mind some recollection of another person, I
		believe our Rector, near us but a little behind us.</p>

		<p>Presently the surface of the gallery extended itself in breadth and
		height, so greatly as to cover the entire organ-loft with it&#8217;s increased
		plane, and it became an immense practising-board, such as, upon a small
		scale, teachers of mathematics use to resolve problems upon for the instruction
		of a class, and it immediately assumed the deep slate-coloured
		hue that such boards are frequently painted.</p>

		<p>And now there arranged themselves upon this board, in white characters,
		problem after problem in Equation; the Rule in which we had been
		exercising. I cannot describe the celerity with which these problems
		were stated upon the board, and worked out to the intense gratification of
		<a class="pagenum" id="page435" title="435"></a>my son and myself; the most difficult and apparently unequal quantities
		being with the rapidity of thought interchanged neutralized reduced
		and determined, so that what seemed at the outset extremely involved,
		became lucid as day, and the unknown quantities made specific to our
		perfect satisfaction in an instant of time.</p>

		<p>We were delighted with the lesson. I felt the hand of my son gently
		pressing mine, as he was accustomed to do when he would evince his
		satisfaction at any thing we examined successfully together; and we
		agreed with each other to cherish the recollection of these elucidations
		for future practice.</p>

		<p>Turning again toward the board, we found it entirely freed from any
		trace of what had been wrought upon it. And now, in a manner which
		I have no possible means of imparting to the Reader, the good and evil
		of Life formed the specific and the unknown quantities that were wrought
		out upon the board. Problem succeeded problem, formed out of various
		conditions of life, with the same rapidity as those in Arabicks had been,
		and though vastly more complicated, with the same satisfactory result.
		Every variety and combination of circumstances in life seemed exhibited;
		positive negative neutral in a moment; until certain trials and
		occurrences led to certain virtues, with the same precision as in the preceding
		series of demonstrations <em>x</em> had for example been shewn to be
		equal to 8. Our joy was beyond expression in words; we embraced
		each other and I well remember saying, &#8216;My dear Hal, this is Truth;
		positive Truth; moral, but as certain and as irrefragible, as any mathematical
		Truth is or ever can be shewn to be.&#8217;</p>

		<p>We turned again toward the Board, and another course altogether of
		demonstrations passed over the surface of it, and was made scrutable to
		our perceptions. By one process the illimitable power of <span class="special_name">God</span> was
		borne in upon my apprehension with a vividness of conception that I had
		never felt before.</p>

		<p>By another I well remember Truth and Wisdom were shewn to be
		one and the same, and all Truth to proceed from and to be an attribute of
		<span class="special_name">God</span>. By another, Infinite Justice, deduced from Infinite Power and Infinite
		Truth, was arrived at, as His essential and necessary quality.
		Again, the revealed Word of <span class="special_name">God</span> as declared in the Bible was established
		in my mind as the irresistible result of another process; and,
		although several had intermediately passed over the Board, this was I
		think the last. The Board faded, the figure at our side disappeared, we
		were out of church, and presently I awoke, and lo! it was a <span class="special_name">Dream</span>!
		But the recollection of that dream has never faded from my memory,
		and I trust that the influences of it may never be lost.</p>

		<p>My mind for some time previous had been much afflicted with considerations
		and doubts respecting the free agency of man, and the truth
		of the Scriptures so far as they relate to everlasting punishment, and to
		the prescience of <span class="special_name">God</span>. These doubts had been infused in conversation
		by the reasoning of an eminent lawyer. If you believe in the doctrine
		of everlasting punishment said he, and believe also in the prescience
		of <span class="special_name">God</span>, and in <span class="special_name">His</span> Omnipotence, must you not admit that <span class="special_name">God</span> might
		prevent the sinner from entering at all into this world of probation? into
		this world of trial which is to prove too severe for his powers of resistance?
		<a class="pagenum" id="page436" title="436"></a>If I know that a candle that I purpose lighting will, from any
		accident, or by any other hand after I shall have lighted it, be made to
		burn my neighbor&#8217;s house; am I not in some degree participant or
		accessary to the consequence if I persist in the intention? Why is
		man to be made subject to consequences more direful to him than if he
		had never been born at all into this world of evil? He has had no voice
		in determining his mission into it, nor has his will been consulted in the
		creation of his spirit, nor in the qualities with which that spirit is endued;
		his existence also in a state of indulgence of wicked impulse, how
		short and limited it has been; and how frequently mingled with the disposition
		if not with repeated Effort toward goodness; shall he for twenty
		years of vice, be subjected to <em>everlasting</em> punishment? how can this
		consist with Divine Justice and Mercy? You say that he has had the
		free option of good and evil; possibly so; but he has not chosen the
		good, he has not adopted the course that leads to everlasting happiness,
		and his everlasting misery might have been prevented; why then should
		he have been called into being? Is not this misery ordained to him,
		since it is not prevented, and since it has always been apparent as the
		result of life to the creative power which must know, and which could
		prevent, and has yet determined to create?</p>

		<p>Now these doubts were weighing on my heart when I first stood before
		that board; and when I had left the church, they were all removed.
		They had made themselves&#8212;air, into which they vanished.
		My hands were clasped together in pleasure at the relief; and when I
		awoke, a sensation, the purest perhaps that life affords, had entire possession
		of my heart, my mind, my soul. It was that gentle, yet etherial
		sensation&#8212;that yellow-green of the ransomed spirit&#8212;when gratitude
		that has never drawn a chain behind it, gratitude free as joy, gratitude
		beautiful as hope, melts into love toward <span class="special_name">Him</span>, &#8216;who first hath loved us!&#8217;</p>

		<div class="poem">
			<div class="stanza">
				<p>&#8216;Parent of Heaven! great Master of mankind!</p>
				<p>Where&#8217;er Thy providence directs, behold</p>
				<p>My steps with cheerful resignation turn!</p>
				<p>Fate leads the willing, drags the backward on.</p>
				<p>Why should I mourn, when grieving I must bear;</p>
				<p>Or take with guilt what, guiltless, I might share!&#8217;</p>

		<h2 class="title">EARLY SPRING AT THE HOMESTEAD.</h2>

		<p class="byline">BY HANS VON SPIEGEL.</p>


		<p><span class="first_word">Lo!</span> here is Spring again, the dainty goddess come back to see what
		Winter has been doing for so many months in forest and meadow, on the
		broad hill-side and in the valley. The old ice-king has had a merry
		time of it, playing with the long branches of the graceful maiden-like
		elm, and wrestling with the gnarled and haughty oak. You might have
		heard him roaring in the depths of the woods, had you been here, venerable
		<span class="special_name">Deidrich</span>, day and night for a sevennight, apparently just for the
		sake of making a noise, and compelling the obeisance of the forest.
		Like any other demagogue, he gains attention by his blusterings. How
		lowly that young poplar bent before him, while the old hemlocks scarcely
		deigned a show of reverence! When you were in your youth, and the
		world seemed larger than now, did you not feel more of respect and
		awe for the <em>great man</em> than you now do? Ah! well-a-day! how little
		is the world&#8217;s esteem worthy of care! Ambition climbs the dizzy steeps
		of fame; the young and inexperienced, whose admiration is not worth
		a straw, applaud; but the wise, for whose good-will Ambition toils, look
		on with indifference; for they know the emptiness of human greatness.
		But while we stop to moralize, the reader grows a-weary; and even
		thou, <span class="special_name">Deidrich</span>, who art so constitutionally polite, compressest thy labial
		muscles, and thumpest nervously the floor with thy gold-headed walking
		stick. What a pity that we cannot talk nonsense gracefully!</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page439" title="439"></a>There, now, all this time has the damsel Spring been awaiting our
		commands, shivering mayhap in her scanty drapery, while we have
		been prating. So it is the world over. The best intentioned forget the
		claims of others, listening to the sweet music of their own sweet voices.
		<span class="special_name">Deidrich</span>, you ought to be here in the country to see what Hans and
		Peter are doing &#8216;at this present.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Just back of the house, (we are at the old Homestead,) the snow has
		melted away, and an impatient crocus is just peeping up to get a look
		at the warm sun. The spruce, at whose foot it grows all the winter
		long, has kindly extended one of its lower branches over it, to shield it
		from the frost, and now straitens it up again to give the poor little plant
		a glimpse or two of the warm blue sky and the golden sun. And here,
		on the southern side of the house, the windows are thrown up, and the
		door of the wing swung open for the first time in four long months.
		There, Peter, in the side of the wing where you see the ends of two or
		three bricks protruding from a circular hole in the clapboards, is the
		nest of a pair of wrens that year after year come back to rear a new
		family, and chirp and chatter away the summer, when their labors have
		ceased. If it were a few weeks later, you might get acquainted with
		the comical little occupants, who are as brisk and busy as if they were
		not in reality great grand-parents to a whole republic of wrens. See!
		on the top of the wood-shed, how proudly the old rooster struts along
		the weather-board, enjoying the discomfiture of his wives, who have
		been trying for this half-hour from the corn-house steps to reach the
		same desirable elevation. And ever and anon he crows to answer the
		tumultuous cackle of the plebeian fowl in the barn-yard, with whom he
		never mingles, save when a hawk threatens them with common danger;
		and then, forgetting all his aristocracy, he seeks the same sheltering
		apple-tree or clump of briars in the fence-corner, where the enemy cannot
		penetrate. Friend Peter, just buckle on your over-shoes and come
		with me through the back gates which have stood open all winter to
		allow ingress to huge sled-loads of fire-wood. Tread carefully over
		the soft snow which &#8216;slumps&#8217; at every step, and let us take a look at the
		barn-yard down yonder, across the way from the farm-house.</p>

		<p>Now is there not some poetry here? That yoke of brindle-oxen
		standing under the dripping eaves chewing their cud; can you not see
		gladness in their broad faces? There is old Line-back, the cow that
		fifteen years ago used to have the same corner. I wonder if she recognizes
		me? She is graver than the other cows; red and black, around
		her butt; the tuft of wool on her horns shows that she retains her old
		spirit, and does not allow the dainty sheep that crowd around us, to pick
		out the most savory portions of her hay, without asserting her rights of
		priority. There, flocking in the hay-loft door, over the cow-house, are
		the cackling multitude which we heard awhile ago. They were probably
		instigated to their clamor by the &#8216;cut-cut-ca-da-cut&#8217; of some
		young hen who had laid the first egg of the season. The rest replying,
		no doubt, that they severally had done the same at some spring-time
		anterior, but now for the first time thought of mentioning so trifling a
		circumstance. Peter sagely opines that they are holding a tea party!
		Let us drop into the &#8216;grain-barn&#8217; and see what Hans&#8217; little brothers are
		<a class="pagenum" id="page440" title="440"></a>raising such a children&#8217;s noise about. There goes Jim from the highest
		scaffold into the straw at the bottom of the &#8216;deep bay.&#8217; Billy is just
		preparing to jump too; and Sid, a little more lazy, is but half up the
		upper ladder. Sid sees us, and without saying a word, begins to climb
		down again. This draws Billy&#8217;s attention, and crying &#8216;Hans has come
		home! Hans has come!&#8217; springs off, half smothering poor Jim in his
		descent. There, now, Peter, after seeing me kiss my brothers, don&#8217;t
		accuse me of possessing a cold heart, merely because I don&#8217;t happen to
		love the women. What is a woman, but flesh and blood after all? Do
		you think those black, flashing eyes and rosy cheeks and swelling bosom,
		and those warm lips which breathe soft deceit the while you press them,
		are any thing more than &#8216;common clay?&#8217; I have seen many lovely
		ones, yet as Byron hath it:</p>

		<div class="poem">
			<div class="stanza">
				<p>&#8216;Maidens, like moths, are ever caught by glare,</p>
				<p>And Mammon wins his way where seraphs might despair.&#8217;</p>
			</div>
		</div>


		<p>I wish, friend Peter, that we could stay a fortnight to enjoy the opening
		of spring, but as we must wend our way eastward day after tomorrow,
		we will resign ourselves to fate, and make the best of it. Look
		down into the valley where Green Brook comes singing and bubbling
		out from the deep shade of the hemlocks into the open meadows! The
		snow has melted away from its margin, and the brown sward is smiling
		in the cheerful afternoon sun. There, on that tall stump, on the other
		side, sits a sentinel crow, while his companions are strolling about
		catching up dainties which the frost and snow have hid from their vision
		the winter long. Hurra! hurra! see over the edge of Pine Hill come
		the first pigeons of the season from the warm south! Look how they
		rise and fall again in their easy flight, as they pass up the valley and go
		whirring in among the dense evergreens. I told you we should see
		pigeons soon, but you thought it too early. We will have sport to-morrow,
		if it is warm. For the present, let us see whether Hans&#8217; old
		fowling-piece is still safe from rust. Here it stands behind his bed-room
		door, dressed up like an old maid for a sailing party, all in flannels.
		There, Peter, is a true &#8216;stubb-and-twist,&#8217; and the locks, although rather
		out of fashion, are still as elastic as ever. This Hans himself will use
		to-morrow; for it is an old friend and might feel hurt to be entrusted
		to the care of a stranger. Here, Jim, run down to Colonel Hyde&#8217;s and
		borrow his long double-barrel; but don&#8217;t tell him that pigeons have been
		seen, or he will want to use it himself. Get a cannister of Dupont,
		and half a dozen pounds of No. 4 shot. None of the fine mustard-seed
		or robin, but the heavy duck-shot, that will enter at twenty rods. That
		is the kind for pigeons, their feathers are so compact; for if you fire at
		them flying, you might as well toss turnip-seed at them as to shoot fine
		shot that will glance from their sleek feathers like drops of rain.</p>

		<p>Here comes Jim, with the colonel&#8217;s gun. Is it not a grand one? Now
		for cleaning the pieces, and filling the flasks and shot-belts. Look out,
		or you will scald your fingers with the hot water. A little more soap,
		and the barrels are as clean as a silver thimble. Snap! These are
		fine caps: put this box into your pocket, or we shall forget it. Let us
		look out at the sunset before tea, and then go to bed early, that we may
		be up in season for to-morrow&#8217;s sport.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page441" title="441"></a>How broadly and slowly the sun sinks behind the forest! The glowing
		points of his diadem reach to the zenith, and the purple clouds that float
		around the west, dazzle the eye as they lie in contrast with the soft blue
		sky. How bland the air is, like that of summer! We can almost drink it.</p>

		<p>Well, mother, I am glad to be at home again at the tea-table. Here,
		Peter, don&#8217;t look sad now because you are not at your own home. We
		will go up in the summer and view Lake Erie in its beauty and vastness,
		and stroll along the beach, beneath the overhanging cedars and larches,
		and the broad-leafed chestnuts. Whose voice is that in the entry? Why,
		Kate, how do you do! Never mind, if you <em>are</em> married, you needn&#8217;t
		start so. I&#8217;m an old friend, you know, and your lips are as tempting
		as ever! Ah! I forgot there were strangers by. Madam Von Rosenbacker:
		Herr von Geist, a man after my own heart. Well, Kate, you
		haven&#8217;t altered much from what you were when we used to pick blackberries
		together. Indeed, I have lost the bottle of wine; you only
		escaped though by three days over the six months that I limited your
		marriage to. You shall have the champaigne, and I will come up in
		the summer to bring it, and will buy an indulgence from the tee-total
		society long enough to drink it with you. Now that she is gone, Peter,
		let me ask if you don&#8217;t think her a glorious woman? Her large blue
		eyes, her soft flaxen hair and rosy cheeks, and tall graceful figure, make
		her &#8216;splendid.&#8217; Peter, she was the first girl that I ever &#8216;set my face
		against,&#8217; as poor <span class="special_name">Power</span> used to say; and now, old bachelor as I am, I
		envy her husband.</p>

		<p>To bed we go, and Somnus touches our eyes with his wand of poppies.
		Ye gods! how sweet and soft a bed at home is, after travelling till one&#8217;s
		bones ache with jolting stages and jarring rail-cars!</p>

		<p class="prose_break">&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;</p>

		<p>Up! up! friend Peter; here we are abed, while daylight is glimmering
		through the blinds. Just put your head out here at this window
		and snuff the fresh spring air. Hear the roaring of Fish Creek as it
		comes up over the wooded hills. By no means! Don&#8217;t suppose for the
		sixtieth part of a minute that I intend to hurry you away without breakfast;
		but you must step down into the kitchen, where the girl has prepared
		us a strong cup of coffee; as good, no doubt, as Mother Bee used
		to provide for our matin meal on College Hill. Here, Dancer, you must
		have some breakfast too.</p>

		<p>Well, are we all ready? Powder, shot, and caps enough, and every
		thing in order? Eh! Peter, what are you twisting your mouth about?
		Ah, yes, indeed, I forgot. Here&#8217;s a dozen Principes to use as occasion
		may offer, and especially after dinner; which is to be sent up with the
		rest into the sugar-bush, where we will rendezvous about one o&#8217;clock,
		and in the afternoon help &#8216;sugar off.&#8217; See the sunlight on the barns
		yonder; how warm it looks! Look off on that hill-side, where the snow
		lies so deep! How like a speck of gold it shimmers to the eye! and
		there goes Dancer on the crust, as if he enjoyed the freshness of the
		air, and the warm sunlight. Let us try the crust too, and if it will bear
		us, we shall save time by going across lots. Here we go, with our heels
		crunching the glittering pavement, leaving scarcely a vestige of our
		tread, the frost of last night has so effectually congealed it. Yonder
		<a class="pagenum" id="page442" title="442"></a>across this valley which the hills prevent our seeing from the house, is
		the sugar-bush, sloping to the south. The canal we first crossed leads
		to the old mills down to the right yonder, where you see that grove of
		black-cherry trees, and the little house on the knoll. The mist that you
		see to the left, rises from the mill-dam, the monotonous hum of whose
		falling waters you have heard for some time. This is Furnace Creek,
		whose swift current harbors the most beautiful trout. That crow yonder
		on the dry hemlock is calling to his mate, and the speckled wood-pecker
		is tapping away at that old beech, that the nice insects within its decayed
		interior may come out to make him a breakfast. Hark! do you not hear
		the drum of that partridge? He is up there in that thicket of young
		beeches and hemlocks, on the other side of the road. As you hear the
		slow, measured drum which he gives at first, and which he hastens into
		a whirr like distant thunder, does not &#8216;The old Man&#8217;s Counsel&#8217; come fresh
		to your memory, and almost ringing in your ear? Ah! this is the glory
		of true poetry, that it clothes the commonest things with a new interest, and
		forever after they become objects of love, at least of meditation. Who
		that has read the same author&#8217;s &#8216;Lines to a Waterfowl,&#8217; does not gaze
		with other than a sportsman&#8217;s pleasure upon even a wild duck, if it flies
		past him after sunset. But there goes a flock of pigeons, and here over
		our heads; one! two! three! more than a hundred in each! What a
		rushing sound their wings make! They fly too high for us just now:
		but wait till we get on the cleared hill yonder to the right of the sugar-bush,
		and we shall have rare sport as they emerge from the trees and
		skim along the edge of the &#8216;clearing.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Here we are in the sugar-bush. Are these not noble trees? For
		how many years have they stood thus interlocking their strong boughs
		like brethren! While Columbus was asking a supper for his boy at
		the convent door, three centuries and a half ago, these same trees were
		here, scarcely younger than now. Yonder is the hill we saw from the
		rude bridge below the mill-dam. Let us clamber over the log-fence and
		get into the clearing.</p>

		<p>Well, Peter, this hill that we are on is just one mile from home, though
		it looks not half the distance. Is this not a glorious view? Hill and
		valley spread out like a map before us! The snow lies in patches upon
		the fields, and the sun is lighting up the tinned spire of the village
		church, which, as the stage passed it yesterday, you thought looked like
		a superannuated old man with a martin-cage upon his crooked back.
		There is the old homestead looking at us through the locusts that surround
		it, and there are the orchards off to the right, which in a few
		weeks will be white with blossoms. Now, steady, my boys! Do you
		see that flock of pigeons? Wait till they pass us, that our shot may
		take effect on their backs. Whang! hack!! bang!!! What! three
		barrels off and only a handful of tail-feathers! How they opened as
		we fired, as if to let the shot go through. Hist! don&#8217;t stir! Look up
		softly into the dry top of this hemlock, right over our heads: four, five,
		six! all in a huddle. I&#8217;ll fetch some of them with my last barrel.
		Snap! fiz! confound the cap! Hold still, they see us. I&#8217;ve got a fresh
		cap on: bang! Here comes one, tumbling through the limbs on to the
		snow. Is he not a handsome bird; with his glossy purple breast and
		<a class="pagenum" id="page443" title="443"></a>slender blue neck! Load quickly, and let us be ready for the next
		flock.</p>

		<p>Hear them scream and coo in the wood to the right. Hear the leaves
		crackle down on that slope where the snow is off under those tall beeches.
		The ground is fairly blue with them. Softly there over the dry brush!
		See them turning up the leaves for beech-nuts: they are all moving
		this way. Down, behind this log: they are not twenty yards off. Cock
		both barrels; and now fire! What a stunning sound they make, like
		the roaring of a tornado! Look, they have settled down again on the
		other side of the ravine. Well, here, Peter, what do you think of the
		fun now?&#8212;fourteen cock pigeons and one hen, to be divided between us.
		This is what <em>I</em> call sport: none of your reed-birds and meadow-larks,
		such as cockney sportsmen frighten away from the fields of Jersey or
		Long-Island. Here they come again by scores. Now let us see how
		good a shot you are. Two cocks on the topmost branch of that old
		maple, full forty yards to the trunk. No, no! don&#8217;t get any nearer, for
		they see you. Well done! Hear him thump on the leaves; and here
		comes the other, fluttering round and round like a shuttlecock. Ten
		to one that you shot him through the head. There! I told you so! His
		wings are not hurt, but a shot has cut away his bill. Here, Dancer,
		don&#8217;t bite him so, but bring him here! Chick, chick, churr! Mister
		Red-squirrel, we&#8217;ll &#8216;give you a few,&#8217; as Jared used to say. On that
		knot in the green hemlock, he sits with his tail spread out over his head,
		for all the world like a young miss in a high-backed, old-fashined easy-chair.
		Well, we wont harm him, for the sake of the associations his
		comical appearance awakens.</p>

		<p>Dancer is barking down in the ravine. There he comes! as if he were
		crazy; he is on the track of a hare! Do you see that pair of slender
		ears pricked up behind the roots of that fallen tree? Let me try my
		skill at a long shot. I&#8217;ve hit them, that&#8217;s poz! No, I haven&#8217;t either;
		for the nimble-footed thing is scudding away round the hill as safe as
		if I had not wasted my loading on her.</p>

		<p>This sunken cask down here where the water wells up through the
		white sand, used to be the father of the cool spring water for the uses
		of the Homestead, and was conveyed the whole distance in &#8216;pump-logs.&#8217;
		You can see the end of one, with an iron band sunk into it, sticking out
		of the earth. This spring, however, has been long exchanged for one
		on higher ground, and the wooden logs for lead pipe, half as expensive,
		and not half so healthy. Just pop over that chip-munk, whose head is
		peeping out of the ground at the foot of the maple sapling. Too cruel!
		Well done! you are growing compassionate all at once. Look out for
		your head! I declare, you escaped narrowly! That dead limb would
		have dispersed all your theology, had it struck your head. Well, Dancer,
		what are you staring at? Do you think the old tree dropped one of its
		limbs on purpose? Ah, ha! I see! Peter, do you see that tuft of dark
		moss in the crotch of that largest maple: well, I am going to shoot at
		it for sport, so here goes! I <em>thought</em> it was a black squirrel; how
		he leaps from the top boughs. Hurrah! here we go over logs and
		through bushes; the squirrel still ahead of us, springing from tree top
		to tree top. How he rattles down the dry splinters as he scratches up
		<a class="pagenum" id="page444" title="444"></a>that dead hemlock. Now we&#8217;ve got him! Go round on the other side
		of the tree and he will dodge back this way, and I shall get a crack at
		him. But he don&#8217;t though! He must have a hole up there. Sure
		enough, there is one! Let me get this old bough broken in two, and I
		will start him. Now be ready, and shoot him as he comes out. The
		old tree is hollow all the way up; it sounds as I strike like an old bass-drum.
		There! he&#8217;s out! blaze away! Not that time did you
		hit him. That&#8217;s better! see him hang by one leg! here he comes!
		&#8216;dead as a door nail!&#8217; Thump! how he struck the ground. What a
		tail he has!</p>

		<p class="prose_break">&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;</p>


		<p>And now we are at the &#8216;boiling place.&#8217; Two strong beech crotches
		are driven into the ground, about twelve feet apart, and a strong pole is
		laid over them, some five feet from the ground. The huge back-log
		was the butt of that tremendous beech you see lying just at the top of
		the knoll. The cauldron you see is filled with the fresh sap two or
		three times a day, and before filling each time, the boiling liquid is
		dipped out into the largest kettle alongside of it, and that in turn is
		emptied into a smaller one, that no time may be lost in boiling it away.
		Taste the syrup in this smaller kettle; it is almost molasses. Try on
		that &#8216;neck-yoke&#8217; and come, let us help carry sap before dinner. The
		spiles you see sticking from augur-holes in every maple are made of
		young sumacs, which are sawed off the right length, and then the pith
		is punched out with a wire. The clean white-pine buckets, without
		bails, into which the sap drips from the spiles, are made expressly for
		this use, and so is that enormous hogshead where the sap is poured before
		it is strained for the cauldron. For the present let us to dinner.
		Well, Herr Peter, although our dinner was laid on a beech log, and our
		table-cloth nothing but a piece of coarse linen, and our knives and forks
		such as Adam and Eve used before us! was it not excellent! Wie
		schmackt es! <em>How smacked it!</em> as it passed through our devouring
		jaws; and how sweet was the pure spring water from the bright tin
		dipper! Now for a quiet smoke on the plank settle in the bough-house,
		while Joe and Hiram are getting ready to &#8216;sugar off.&#8217; Here, if there
		comes up a storm, they sit and watch the kettles; and sometimes when
		the weather is clear they sit up all night. So at last you <em>do</em> love a cigar
		better than a meerschaum? I confess it is the same with me! How old
		<span class="special_name">Deidrich</span> would frown, if he heard such an admission from those who
		boast as we do the pure <em>Deutchen-blut</em>, the true Dutch blood!</p>

		<p>What! two o&#8217;clock so soon! They have hung the ten-pail kettle
		that contains the thick syrup upon a pole between two slender crotches,
		and have already kindled a fire. How it bubbles and &#8216;blubbers&#8217; up,
		like thick hasty-pudding, with a dignified slowness that is inimitable.
		Now it rises to the top of the kettle and will boil over! O, you needn&#8217;t
		turn up your nose at the slice of clean fat pork that Joe has just thrown
		in, for that has saved our sugar. See, it gradually subsides till it rests
		a third way down. You have heard that oil will still the surface of
		the sea; and the oily part of the pork answers the same purpose with
		the boiling syrup. Now it begins to granulate, swing it off. Here, drop
		some of it into this bucket of cold water, and then poke it out with that
		<a class="pagenum" id="page445" title="445"></a>pine stick, while I run up on the side-hill yonder and get a pail of snow,
		which will cool it faster. Ha, ha, ha! you do look handsome; suppose
		Meeta could see you with your jaws stuck fast together with the candy,
		and your face looking like the head of Medusa. While you are getting
		over the lock-jaw, I will trail some on this snow to take home to little
		Sue, who begged me to bring her back some maple candy. Now let us
		ride down home on the ox-sled, with the huge tin pails full of the hot
		syrup, which wont get half cold before it is safe in the farm-house pantry,
		in a half dozen well-buttered milk-pans to harden for future use.</p>

		<p>Once more in bed after a hearty supper; and once more out of it,
		too, for the stage horn is blown. We must hurry or we are left; for
		it stops only fifteen or twenty minutes to change the mail.</p>

		<p class="prose_break">&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;</p>

		<p>Yes, Peter, this Brookline <em>is</em> a little cleaner than Broadway.</p>

		<p class="subtitle">DURING THE POPISH PLOT.</p>

		<p><span class="first_word">The</span> recent Irish State Trials seem to have been conducted on the
		part of the government with something of the same violence and partiality
		that dishonor the ancient records of Great Britain&#8217;s criminal
		jurisprudence. The exclusion of Roman Catholics from the jury was
		an arbitrary and unwarrantable act; unjust in itself, disrespectful
		to the larger portion of the Irish people, and calculated to destroy the
		moral effect of the verdict, by producing the impression on the public
		mind that the prisoners did not have a fair trial. We would not be understood
		as complaining of the verdict. We do not see how, with a
		strict adherence to the law and to the evidence, the jury could well have
		decided otherwise. It is the eagerness to convict the prisoners manifested
		on the part of the law-officers of the crown that is the object of
		just reprehension.</p>

		<p>Trials for offences against the State have happily been almost unknown
		in this country, and we therefore find it difficult to conceive of
		the dangers to which a prisoner is exposed, when the whole power of
		the government is arrayed against him. But to one familiar with the
		iniquitous manner in which they were conducted in Great Britain during
		the seventeenth, and the earlier part of the eighteenth century, the proceedings
		against O&#8217;Connell and his associates seem almost models of
		judicial fairness and impartiality. To one not thus familiar, it is difficult
		to convey an adequate idea of the extent to which legal tribunals
		prostituted their functions to purposes of oppression and revenge. The
		judges holding their offices by the slight tenure of royal favor, and generally
		owing their elevation to the zeal they had shown to defend the
		royal prerogatives, were, with a few honorable exceptions, willing instruments
		in the hands of power. The interpreters of the law, who,
		like the prophets of old, were bound to curse, or to bless, in obedience
		to higher impulses than their own wills, became the mere mouth-pieces
		of the government; the injustice of the decisions imperfectly concealed
		<a class="pagenum" id="page447" title="447"></a>by the sanctity of the office. Justice, and the favor of the court were
		identical. The law and the royal pleasure were inseparably associated
		in the mind of the judge.</p>

		<p>We would not be understood as meaning that the English judges were
		unjust, or partial in the trials between private citizens. In these cases
		it was not often that there was any obstacle interposed to the administration
		of even-handed justice. It was when the government came in as
		a party; when political offenders were to be tried, that they too often
		proved false to their trust. The temptations of office; the love of ease,
		wealth, and distinction; the fear of ministerial enmity, of royal disgrace,
		were too powerful for poor Honesty. The hour in which their
		aid was most needed by the friendless prisoner, was that in which it was
		withdrawn; for surely if men ever need an upright, able, and impartial
		administration of the law, it is when they contend single-handed
		against the influences of flattery, bribery, and intimidation, which those
		in authority are ever able to employ. The odds are fearful in such a
		contest. The prejudices of juries, the subservience of lawyers, the
		servility of judges, gave scarce a hope that justice would not be wrested
		to serve the purposes of the crown; that considerations of state policy
		would not prove stronger than any abstract belief of the prisoner&#8217;s innocence
		or guilt. That we have not misrepresented the degraded condition
		of the English tribunals during the period we have mentioned, a
		referencé to the state trials <i>passim</i>, will abundantly prove. Nor is it at
		all strange that such should have been the case. During the dynasty
		of the Tudors, and the reign of the first of the Stuarts, the duty alike
		of the courts, and of parliament was simply to register the royal edicts.
		If the formalities of law were observed, it was rather through the good-nature
		of the sovereign, than from any consciousness of his inability to
		break through their restraints. But after the rebellion, and especially
		after the revolution, when the limits of prerogative became marked out
		with some degree of precision, and monarchs could no longer effect their
		purposes by open violence, then more subtle means were resorted to,
		but scarcely less dangerous, to destroy those who were so unfortunate
		as to become the objects of royal or ministerial enmity. The king, if
		he could not make the law, could still appoint the judges of the law;
		and the right of interpretation was hardly less powerful than the power
		of legislation. Even when, after a lapse of time, the judges became in
		a great measure independent of the crown, still it was not until many
		years later, when the voice of an outraged people became more terrible
		to them than the frowns of kings or ministers, that those accused of political
		offence could hope for justice at their hands.</p>

		<p>The reign of Charles the Second, in every respect the most disgraceful
		in English history, is that period to which we wish now particularly to
		ask the reader&#8217;s attention. During the latter part of it, the chief justice&#8217;s
		seat was filled first by Scroggs, and afterwards by Jeffries; the
		former came to the bench a little before the disclosures that took place
		respecting the Popish Plot, and presided at the trials that took place in
		consequence of that event. It is to these trials that we shall now confine
		ourselves; only premising certain facts necessary to the perfect
		understanding of the extracts which we are about to make.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page448" title="448"></a>It is unnecessary to go minutely into the details of the Popish Plot. A
		general outline will answer our present purpose. The first who pretended
		any knowledge of it, or made any disclosure respecting it, was
		Titus Oates. He, when examined before the council in October, 1678,
		stated that at a consult held by the Jesuits on the 24th of April preceding,
		at the White Horse Tavern in London, resolutions had been adopted
		to kill the king, overthrow the established church, and restore popery.
		Upon this many arrests were made, and among others was Coleman,
		who had been secretary to the late Duchess of York. His papers were
		seized, and there was found a correspondence he had carried on several
		years before with the confessor of Louis XIV., having reference mainly
		to the restoration of the Catholic religion in England. These letters,
		although in no way confirmatory of the alleged Plot, except so far as
		they indicated an anxious desire on the part of the members of that
		church to regain their lost ascendency in Great Britain, and their intention
		to use every effort for that purpose, things already well known,
		yet produced great excitement, and were regarded by many as conclusive
		proof of the truth of Oates&#8217; statements. Another event, which
		happened about the same time, raised the excitement to its highest
		pitch. Sir Edmundbury Godfrey, a London magistrate, before whom
		Oates had made his depositions, was found murdered, and under such
		circumstances as precluded the idea of suicide. Suspicion now deepened
		into certainty. No one longer dared to doubt the reality of the
		plot. To doubt, was to confess one&#8217;s self an accomplice. Nothing was
		talked of but the Plot. The wildest rumors were caught up and
		repeated, and soon grew into well-authenticated facts. The name
		Papist, or Roman Catholic, became synonymous with assassin. Many,
		not content with carrying arms, clothed themselves in armor. At the
		funeral of Sir Edmondbury Godfrey, says North, in his Examen, &#8216;the
		crowd was prodigious, both at the procession, and in and about the
		church, and so heated, that any thing called Papist, were it a cat or a
		dog, had probably gone to pieces in a moment. The Catholics all kept
		close in their houses and lodgings, thinking it a good compensation to
		be safe there, so far were they from acting violently at that time. But
		there was all that which upheld among the common people an artificial
		fright, so that every one almost fancied a popish knife just at his throat;
		and at the sermon, beside the preacher, two thumping divines stood upright
		in the pulpit, to guard him from being killed while he was preaching,
		by the Papists.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Oates immediately became a man of great consequence. He was
		called the saviour of the nation, had lodgings given him at Whitehall,
		and a pension from parliament of £1200 a year. But the more cool and
		circumspect could not forget the notorious infamy of his character, or
		implicitly rely on the word of a man who openly confessed that he had
		gone among the Jesuits, and declared himself a convert to their faith
		merely to betray them. But with the populace his credit was unbounded.
		The more incredible his fictions, the better they suited the vulgar appetite.
		In this sort of narrative, as Hume truly remarks, a fool was
		more likely to succeed than a wise man. Accompanied by his guards,
		for being supposed to be a special object of popish enmity, guards had
		<a class="pagenum" id="page449" title="449"></a>been assigned him, he walked about in great dignity, attired as a priest,
		and &#8216;whoever he pointed at was taken up and committed; so that many
		people got out of his way as from a blast, and glad they could prove
		their two last years&#8217; conversation. The very breath of him was pestilential,
		and if it brought not imprisonment or death over such on whom
		it fell, it surely poisoned reputation, and left good Protestants arrant
		papists, and something worse than that, in danger of being put in the
		plot as traitors.&#8217;<a href="#fn1" class="fnmarker" title="North's 'Examen.'" id="fnm1" name="fnm1">1</a></p>

		<p>Parliament was opened three days after Godfrey&#8217;s murder, and immediately
		voted that it was of opinion that there had been, and was &#8216;a
		damnable and hellish plot;&#8217; and every day, both forenoon and afternoon,
		a session was held at which the whole matter was discussed. The
		arrests were numerous, and among others were several papist lords,
		and Sir George Wakeman, the physician to the queen. Even the Duke
		of York and the Queen herself were accused by Oates as traitors and
		accomplices. These stories meeting such general credence, and rewards
		being heaped upon the author, others, as might have been expected,
		soon followed his example. The most notorious of these minor perjurers
		was one Bedlow, who pretended to know the secret of Godfrey&#8217;s murder.
		When first examined he knew nothing of the Plot, but told a ridiculous
		story about forty thousand men who were coming over to England from
		Spain. The next day, however, his knowledge was greatly increased,
		and he pretended to be as fully informed of all the particulars of the
		Plot as Oates himself. As we shall see by and by, whatever the bolder
		villain swore to, his subordinate confirmed.</p>

		<p>Such was the state of things when the first victim of this extraordinary
		popular delusion were brought to trial. The earliest trial,
		although the accused was not charged with being concerned in the plot,
		was that of Stayley, a goldsmith or broker, on the 21st of November,
		1678. The charge against him was that he had called the king a heretic,
		and threatened to kill him. The chief witness against him was
		one Castars. Bishop Burnet, who was well acquainted with him, says,
		that when he heard who the witnesses were, he thought he was bound
		to do what he could to stop it: &#8216;so I sent both to the lord chancellor and
		the attorney general to let them know what profligate wretches these
		witnesses were. Jones, the attorney general, took it ill of me that I
		should disparage the king&#8217;s evidence. Duke Lauderdale, having heard
		how I had moved in this matter, railed at me with open mouth. He
		said I had studied to save Stayley for the liking I had to any one that
		would murder the king.&#8217; The trial proceeded, and one of the witnesses
		testified to the following words as spoken by the prisoner: &#8216;The King of
		England is the greatest heretic, and the greatest rogue in the world;
		here&#8217;s the heart and here&#8217;s the hand that would kill him; I myself.&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Prisoner</span>. &#8216;Here&#8217;s the hand, and here&#8217;s the heart that would kill
		myself; not would kill him myself.&#8217;</p>

		<p>L. C. J. &#8216;What Jesuit taught you this trick? It is like one of
		them. It is the art and interest of a Jesuit so to do.&#8217;</p>

		<p>In this, as in all the subsequent trials, the existence of the Plot was
		<a class="pagenum" id="page450" title="450"></a>taken for granted as an incontestable fact. Another fact was also assumed,
		most improperly indeed, but not without some show of reason, that
		it was an admitted doctrine of the Romish church, that however sinful
		an act might be in itself, it lost its sinfulness if the interests of the church
		demanded its performance. Therefore it was argued, to kill a heretic-king,
		to swear falsely, to deceive an enemy, is to do nothing wrong in
		the eyes of a Papist, if the pope or the bishops command it. Such a
		man it is proper for us to regard as an enemy, for his principles would
		lead him to employ any means for the destruction of those whom he was
		taught to regard as the enemies of his church.</p>

		<p>It is unnecessary for us to stop to point out the fallacy of this mode of
		reasoning. Our business at present is only to show the effect it had upon
		the minds both of the court and the jury. Thus the Chief Justice
		reasoned in his charge at the trial: &#8216;You, and we all, are sensible of
		the great difficulties and hazards that is now both against the king&#8217;s
		person, and against all Protestants, and our religion too; which will
		hardly maintain itself, when they have destroyed the men; but let &#8217;em
		know that many thousands will lose their religion with their lives, for
		we will not be Papists, let the Jesuits press what they will, (who are the
		foundations of all this mischief,) in making proselytes by telling them,
		Do what wickedness you will, it&#8217;s no sin, but we can save you; and if
		you omit what we command, we can damn you. Excuse if I am a little
		warm, when perils are so many, their murders so secret, that we
		cannot discover the murder of that gentleman whom we all knew so
		well, when things are transacted so closely, and our king in so great
		danger, and our religion at stake. &#8217;Tis better to be warm here than in
		Smithfield. When a Papist once hath made a man a heretic, there is no
		scruple to murder him. Whoever is not of their persuasion are heretics,
		and whoever are heretics may be murdered if the pope commands
		it; for which they may become saints in heaven; this is that they have
		practised. If there had been nothing of this in this kingdom, or other
		parts of the world, it would be a hard thing to impose it upon them; but
		they ought not to complain when so many instances are against them.
		Therefore discharge your consciences as you ought to do; if guilty, let
		him take the reward of his crime, and you shall do well to begin with
		this man, for perchance it may be a terror to the rest. Unless they
		think they can be saved by dying in the Roman faith, though with such
		pernicious and traitorous words and designs as these are, let such go to
		Heaven by themselves. I hope I shall never go to that Heaven, where
		men are made saints for killing kings.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The flimsy logic and cool-blooded cruelty of this charge are too obvious
		to require mention. According to the chief justice, no Papist
		could complain that he was hanged for treason because some members
		of his church had massacred the Protestants on Bartholomew&#8217;s day.
		The recommendation &#8216;to begin with this man, that it may be a terror to
		the rest,&#8217; marks well the character of the judge, and the temper of the
		jury that could advance or approve such a detestable doctrine.</p>

		<p>Stayley was convicted and thus sentenced: &#8216;You shall return to prison,
		from thence shall be drawn to the place of execution, where you
		shall be hanged by the neck, cut down alive, your quarters shall be
		<a class="pagenum" id="page451" title="451"></a>severed, and be disposed of as the king shall think fit, and your bowels
		burnt, and so the Lord have mercy on your soul.&#8217;</p>

		<p>This sentence was executed five days after.</p>

		<p>The next victim was Coleman. The evidence against him was of a
		twofold nature; his own letters, and the testimony of Oates and Bedlow.
		As to the first, they disclose clearly enough the existence of a Plot, but
		a Plot in which Charles himself was the chief conspirator; a Plot not
		only to restore popery, but to destroy English liberty. This Plot was
		of an early date, and began indeed almost at the restoration of the king.
		The monarch of France and the Duke of York were his accomplices.
		Coleman&#8217;s part in it seems to have been merely that of an ambitious, intriguing,
		bigotted partizan, pleased with being entrusted with the secrets
		of the great; and much disposed to magnify the importance and value
		of his services. His letters, that were produced on his trial, related to
		the years 1674 and &#8217;5. If there was any correspondence of a later
		date, it was never discovered. In fine, we may say of these letters that
		if there was enough in them to convict Coleman of high treason, the
		king, the duke, and several of the most prominent statesmen of that period
		were equally guilty.</p>

		<p>The testimony of Oates was so strange and improbable, that it never
		could have obtained credence for a moment, except at a time when men
		had &#8216;lost their reason.&#8217; The basis of his whole narration, was his
		statement relating to the consult of the Jesuits in April, which we give in
		his own words. &#8216;They were ordered to meet by virtue of a brief from
		Rome, sent by the father general of the society. They went on to these
		resolves: That Pickering and Grove should go on, and continue in
		attempting to assassinate the king&#8217;s person by shooting, or other means.
		Grove was to have fifteen hundred pounds. Pickering being a religious
		man, was to have thirty thousand masses, which at twelvepence a
		mass amounted to much that money. This resolve of the Jesuits was
		communicated to Mr. Coleman in my hearing at Wild House. My
		lord, this was not only so, but in several letters he did mention it, and in
		one letter, (I think I was gone a few miles out of London,) he sent to me
		by a messenger, and did desire the duke might be trepaned into this Plot
		to murder the king.&#8217;</p>

		<p>But one consult of fifty Jesuits, all eager to carry their diabolical
		plans of assassination and murder into execution, was not enough for
		Dr. Oates, and he went on to relate the proceedings that took place at
		another, held at the Savoy in the month of August, when the Benedictine
		monks were present with the Jesuits. &#8216;In this letter,&#8217; (one written
		by Archbishop Talbot, the titular archbishop of Dublin,) &#8216;there were
		four Jesuits had contrived to despatch the Duke of Ormond. (These
		were his words.) To find the most expedient way for his death Fogarthy
		was to be sent to do it by poison, if these four good fathers did not
		hit of their design. My lord, Fogarthy was present. And when the
		consult was almost at a period, Mr. Coleman came to the Savoy to the
		consult, and was mighty forward to have father Fogarthy sent to Ireland
		to despatch the duke by poison. This letter did specify they were then
		ready to rise in rebellion against the king for the pope.&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Att. Gen.</span> &#8216;Do you know any thing of arms?&#8217;</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page452" title="452"></a>&#8216;There were forty thousand black bills; I am not so skilful in arms
		to know what they meant, (military men know what they are,) that
		were provided to be sent into Ireland for the use of the Catholic party.&#8217;</p>

		<p>In addition to the forty thousand black bills, Oates stated that there
		had been £200,000 contributed by the Catholics, and that he heard Coleman
		say &#8216;that he had found a way to transmit it for the carrying on of
		the rebellion in Ireland.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Here certainly was treason enough concocted, if one could believe the
		witnesses, to have hung a hundred men. No less than seven men had
		engaged to kill the king; all of whom, through some strange infelicity,
		did not find an opportunity even to make the attempt. Not satisfied
		with this number of assassins, Coleman would have had the Duke of
		York brought into the Plot, and made the murderer of his brother.
		Could human folly frame a set of lies more gross and palpable?</p>

		<p>Beside Coleman&#8217;s general knowledge of the Plot, Oates mentioned
		several circumstances showing the special interest that he had taken in
		it; that he had written letters which the witness had carried to St.
		Omers, in which were these &#8216;expressions of the king, calling him tyrant,
		and that the marriage between the Prince of Orange and the Lady Mary,
		the Duke of York&#8217;s eldest daughter, would prove the traitor&#8217;s and tyrant&#8217;s
		ruin;&#8217; that &#8216;this letter was written in plain English words at
		length;&#8217; that he had sent another letter in which he promised &#8216;that the
		ten thousand pounds&#8217; (sent by the Jesuits,) &#8216;should be employed for no
		other intent or purpose but to cut off the King of England;&#8217; and that he
		had given money that &#8216;the four Irish ruffians,&#8217; who were to kill the king
		at Windsor, might be speedy in their business.</p>

		<p>In all these trials there is nothing that more strikingly shows the infamous
		manner in which these witnesses were allowed to testify, than the
		withholding of such parts of their evidence as they pretended it was
		improper at that time to bring forward. Thus they protected themselves;
		for no one durst accuse them lest he himself should be charged as a party
		to the conspiracy. At this trial Oates said, without a word of dissent
		from the Chief Justice, &#8216;I could give other evidence but will not, because
		of other things which are not fit to be known yet.&#8217;</p>

		<p>It is impossible that the Chief Justice, or the other judges, should have
		believed such a story as this even for a moment. We make all necessary
		allowance for the influence of great popular excitement. We
		know that judges are but men, and are not exempt more than other men
		from the contagion of those occasional outbursts of frenzy, which seem
		to destroy all individual independence, and all sense of individual responsibility;
		and which for a time makes a nation like a herd of maddened
		buffaloes, ignorant whither it is going, but unable to stop in its
		furious career. Yet by their position judges are, of all classes of men,
		the farthest removed from popular influences of this nature. Their
		habits of legal investigation, fit them in an eminent degree to weigh
		with scrupulous accuracy the characters of witnesses; to detect improbabilities
		and contradictions. Stories that may deceive even intelligent men
		unacquainted with the laws of evidence, and the bearings of testimony,
		stand revealed at first glance to the practised eye of the judge as a tissue
		of falsehoods. Here the judges could not have been deceived.
		<a class="pagenum" id="page453" title="453"></a>Who could believe that the Jesuits, a body of men not less celebrated
		for their profound knowledge of the politics of every kingdom in Christendom,
		than for the wisdom with which they adapted their plans of
		proselytism to the changing circumstances of the times, should have
		formed a plan to restore popery in England by massacre and conquest?
		The thing is too preposterous to merit a moment&#8217;s attention.</p>

		<p>Still more ridiculous are the details of the Plot as disclosed by Oates.
		Would the Jesuits, even if they had formed such plans, confide them to
		a penniless, friendless vagabond; a man of notoriously bad character,
		who was, while at St. Omers, the butt and laughing stock of the whole
		college? Such secrets are not usually revealed to any but tried men,
		and the Jesuits were the last of all conspirators to bestow their confidence
		rashly. Yet here was a conspiracy whose disclosure would have
		brought a certain and speedy death to every one engaged in it, known we
		know not to how many hundreds, and many of these too found in the
		lowest ranks of the populace. The manner of its execution is of a
		piece with all the rest. First, two men were employed to kill the king.
		For two years they could find no opportunity to do it. Then four Irish
		ruffians were employed. Who they were, or what became of them, no
		one knew. Then the physician of the queen was hired to poison him.
		To this horrible plan of assassination, were consenting not only the highest
		dignitaries of the Romish church, but some of the noblest peers of
		England and of France. But we have neither time nor patience to proceed
		farther with such miserable fabrications. We say then that the
		judges never could have believed in the existence of such a Plot, and
		that the prisoners tried before them were immolated upon the altar of
		their own personal popularity. Rather than resist the current of popular
		feeling, and dare to award justice and uphold the supremacy of
		impartial law, they chose to swim with the tide, and sacrifice men whom
		they knew in their hearts to be innocent. It is this that adds tenfold
		guilt to the brutality of their conduct. We cannot forget that they were
		dishonest in their very cruelty; that they insulted their victims, browbeat
		the witnesses, trampled on judicial forms to gain the favor of an
		infuriated mob, whose madness they laughed at and derided.</p>

		<p>At the commencement of the trial, Coleman thus alluded to the law
		of England, forbidding counsel to prisoners accused of criminal offences,
		and to the prejudice that then prevailed against those of his religion:
		&#8216;I hope, my lord, if there be any point of law that I am not skilled in,
		that your lordships will be pleased not to take the advantage over me.
		Another thing seems most dreadful, that is, the violent prejudice that
		seems to be against every man in England that is confessed to be a Roman
		Catholic. It is possible that a Roman Catholic may be very innocent
		of these crimes. If one of those innocent Roman Catholics should
		come to this bar, he lies under such disadvantages already, and his prejudices
		so greatly biasseth human nature, that unless your lordships will
		lean extremely much on the other side, justice will hardly stand upright
		and lie upon a level.&#8217;</p>

		<p>L. C. J. &#8216;You need not make any preparations for us in this matter;
		you shall have a fair, just and legal trial; if condemned it will be
		apparent you ought to be so; and without a fair proof there shall be no
		<a class="pagenum" id="page454" title="454"></a>condemnation. Therefore you shall find we will not do to you as you
		do to us, blow up at adventure, kill people because they are not of your
		persuasion: our religion teacheth us another doctrine, and you shall find
		it clearly to your advantage.&#8217;</p>

		<p>This was fairness and impartiality in the eyes of the Chief Justice!</p>

		<p>Coleman did not conduct his defence with so much ability as his reputation
		might lead us to expect. He seems to have been dismayed at the
		dangers that threatened him, and hopeless of a fair trial, bowed before
		the storm. An attempted alibi was feebly supported, although Oates
		was so indefinite in regard to time that to attempt to convict him of
		falsehood was of little avail. The chief points of his defence were the
		improbability of the whole story, and the fact that Oates on his examination
		before the council had said that he did not know him. Oates
		thus excused himself: &#8216;My lord, when Mr. Coleman was upon his
		examination before the council board, he saith I said that I never saw
		him before in my life; I then said that I would not swear that I had
		seen him before in my life, because my sight was bad by candle-light,
		and candle-light alters the sight much; but when I heard him speak,
		I could have sworn it was he, but it was not then my business. I cannot
		see a great way by candle-light.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Being asked why he had not accused Coleman at the same time when
		he accused Wakeman and the Jesuits, he pretended that it was &#8216;for
		want of memory. Being disturbed and wearied in sitting up two nights,
		I could not give that good account of Mr. Coleman, which I did afterwards
		when I consulted my papers;&#8217; as if in giving the names of many
		meaner persons, he should from forgetfulness overlook one so considerable
		as Coleman. The testimony of Oates was confirmed by Bedlow,
		who did not hesitate to swear to any thing that the more inventive genius
		of his fellow-witness had devised.</p>

		<p>In summing up, the Chief Justice animadverted with considerable force
		upon the nature of the letters that had been read as proof of a design to
		restore popery in England; this he most unjustifiably argued, could not
		be effected by peaceable means: &#8216;Therefore,&#8217; he says, &#8216;there must be
		more in it, for he that was so earnest in that religion would not have
		stuck at any violence to bring it in; he would not have stuck at blood.
		For we know their doctrines and their practises, and we know well with
		what zeal the priests push them forward to venture their own lives, and
		take away other men&#8217;s that differ from them, to bring in their religion
		and to set up themselves.&#8217;</p>

		<p>After speaking of the general ignorance of the Papists, and the general
		diffusion of knowledge among the Protestants, &#8216;insomuch that scarce
		a cobbler but is able to baffle any Roman priest that ever I saw or met
		with,&#8217; he goes on; &#8216;and after this I wonder that a man who hath been
		bred up in the Protestant religion, (as I have reason to believe that you,
		Mr. Coleman, have been, for if I am not misinformed your father was a
		minister in Suffolk,) for such a one to depart from it, is an evidence
		against you to prove the indictment. I must make a difference between
		us and those who have been always educated that way. No man of
		understanding, but for by-ends, would have left his religion to be a
		Papist. And for you, Mr. Coleman, who are a man of reason and
		<a class="pagenum" id="page455" title="455"></a>subtilty, I must tell you, (to bring this to yourself,) upon this account,
		that it could not be conscience; I cannot think it to be conscience.
		Your pension was your conscience, and your secretary&#8217;s place your bait.
		I do acknowledge many of the popish priests formerly were learned men,
		and may be so still beyond the seas; but I could never yet meet with
		any here, that had any other learning or ability but artificial, only to
		delude weak women and weaker men.</p>

		<p>&#8216;They have indeed ways of conversion and conviction by enlightening
		our understandings with a faggot, and by the powerful and irresistible
		arguments of a dagger. But these are such wicked solecisms in their
		religion, that they seem to have left them neither natural sense nor natural
		conscience. Not natural sense, by their absurdity in so unreasonable
		a belief as of the wine turned into blood: not natural conscience, by
		their cruelty, who make the Protestant&#8217;s blood as wine, and these priests
		thirst after it. <i>Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum.</i></p>

		<p>&#8216;Mr. Coleman, in one of his letters, speaks of rooting out our religion
		and our party; and he is in the right, for they can never root out the
		Protestant religion but they must kill the Protestants. But let him and
		them know, if ever they shall endeavor to bring popery in by destroying
		of the king, they shall find that the Papists will thereby bring destruction
		upon themselves, so that not a man of them would escape.</p>

		<blockquote>
		<p>&#8216;Ne catulus quidem relinquendus.&#8217;</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>&#8216;Our execution shall be as quick as their gunpowder, but more effectual.
		And so, gentlemen, I shall leave it to you to consider what his
		letters prove him guilty of directly, and what by consequence what he
		plainly would have done, and then how he would have done it, and
		whether you think his <i>fiery zeal</i> had so much <i>cold blood</i> in it as to spare
		any others.</p>

		<p>&#8216;For the other part of the evidence, which is by the testimony of the
		present witnesses, you have heard them: I will not detain you longer
		now; the day is going out.&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Mr. Justice Jones</span>. &#8216;You must find the prisoner guilty, or bring in
		two persons perjured.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The verdict was what might have been anticipated from such a
		charge. Coleman was found guilty, and the next day sentenced. After
		sentence had been pronounced, he protested his innocence, but was
		brutally interrupted by the Chief Justice: &#8216;I am sorry, Mr. Coleman, that
		I have not charity enough to believe the words of a dying man.&#8217;</p>

		<p>In answer to Coleman&#8217;s request that his wife might visit him in prison,
		he at first seemed disposed to deny it, and said: &#8216;You say well, and it is
		a hard case to deny it; but I tell you what hardens my heart: the insolencies
		of your party, (the Roman Catholics I mean,) that they every
		day offer, which is indeed a proof of their Plot, that they are so bold and
		impudent, and such secret murders committed by them as would harden
		any man&#8217;s heart to do the common favors of justice and charity that to
		mankind are usually done. They are so bold and insolent that I think
		it is not to be endured in a Protestant kingdom.&#8217;</p>

		<p>His request however was granted. He was executed the third of
		December following.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page456" title="456"></a>We have dwelt with some particularity upon this trial, not because it
		is by any means the most flagrant for the contemptuous disregard shown
		by the judges, not only to the legal rights, but to the feelings of the prisoner,
		but because it came first in the order of time, and serves in a good
		measure to explain all the trials that follow it. Comment upon it is
		needless. Such a mockery of justice would disgrace the tribunals of
		savages. Whatever seems unfavorable to the prisoner is pressed home
		by the Chief Justice, most strongly against him. Whatever makes for
		him is kept out of sight. To have been born a Roman Catholic is a
		crime; to have deliberately adopted that faith, is a damnable sin; one
		for which there is no expiation. The absurd fictions of Oates and Bedlow
		are commended to the jury as worthy of implicit credence. The
		whole weight of judicial authority and influence is thrown into the scale
		of condemnation.</p>

		<p>On the seventeenth of the same December, Whitebread, Fenwick,
		Ireland, Pickering and Grove, were brought to trial. The chief witnesses
		against them were Oates and Bedlow. The counsel for the crown
		thus opened the case: &#8216;May it please your lordships, and you gentlemen
		of the jury, the persons here before you stand indicted of high treason;
		they are five in number; three of them are Jesuits, one is a priest,
		the fifth is a layman; persons fitly prepared for the work in hand.&#8217;
		After a few other observations, he proceeds to institute a comparison between
		this Plot and the famous Gunpowder Plot. The second and third
		points of resemblance in the two, he thus states: &#8216;Secondly, the great
		actors in the design were priests and Jesuits, that came from Valladolid
		in Spain, and other places beyond the seas. And the great actors in
		this Plot are priests and Jesuits that are come from St. Omers and other
		places beyond the seas, nearer home than Spain.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Thirdly, that Plot was chiefly guided and managed by Henry Garnet,
		superior and provincial of the Jesuits then in England; and the
		great actor in this design is Mr. Whitebread, superior and provincial of
		the Jesuits now in England.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The evidence of Oates was the same in substance that he gave at
		Coleman&#8217;s trial, but with such additional particulars as he judged necessary
		to keep the popular excitement alive. Thus, in answering the
		question, what he knew of any attempts to kill the king at St. James&#8217;
		park, he said: &#8216;I saw Pickering and Grove several times walking in
		the park together, with their secured pistols, which were longer than
		ordinary pistols, and shorter than some carbines. They had silver bullets
		to shoot with, and Grove would have had the bullets to be champt
		for fear that if he should shoot, if the bullets were round, the wound
		that might be given might be cured.&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Att. Gen</span>. &#8216;Do you know any thing of Pickering&#8217;s doing penance,
		and for what?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Yes, my lord. In the month of March last, (for these persons have
		followed the king several years;) but he at that time had not looked to
		the flint of his pistol, but it was loose, and he durst not venture to give
		fire. He had a fair opportunity, as Whitebread said; and because he
		missed it through his own negligence he underwent penance, and had
		<a class="pagenum" id="page457" title="457"></a>twenty or thirty strokes of discipline, and Grove was chidden for his
		carelessness.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Of the &#8216;four Irish ruffians&#8217; that went to Windsor to kill the king,
		Oates could give no account. How he could reconcile it with his duty
		to His Majesty to let these assassins lie in wait from August to October,
		without notifying any one of their murderous intentions, he did not see
		fit to explain, and of course the attorney general and the judges forgot
		to ask him.</p>

		<p>Not the least wonderful part of his evidence is that which he speaks
		of the ill usage he received from Whitebread in September, who
		charged him with having betrayed them: &#8216;So, my lord, I did profess a
		great deal of innocency, because I had not then been with the king, but
		he gave me very ill language, and abused me, and I was afraid of a
		worse mischief from them. And though, my lord, they could not prove
		that I had discovered it, yet upon the bare suspicion, I was beaten and
		affronted, and reviled, and commanded to go beyond sea again; nay,
		my lord, I had my lodgings assaulted to have murdered me if they
		could.&#8217;</p>

		<p>This is certainly the strangest way to conciliate a disaffected conspirator,
		that we ever heard of! Most men would have preferred to use
		bribes and caresses; but the Jesuits, it seems, knew their man, and chose
		to beat him into secrecy and submission!</p>

		<p>Bedlow&#8217;s evidence, as usual, was mainly confirmatory of the statements
		of Oates, embellished by such new incidents as his feebler powers
		of invention could frame. He was, however, not quite satisfied with
		this subordinate part; and therefore at the close of his evidence pretends
		to recollect that he had omitted one thing very material: &#8216;At the same
		time that there was a discourse about these three gentleman being
		to destroy the king at New-Market, there was a discourse of a design to
		kill several noble persons, and the several parts assigned to every one.
		Knight was to kill the Earl of Shaftsbury, Pritchard, the Duke of Buckingham,
		Oniel, the Earl of Ossory, Obrian, the Duke of Ormond,&#8217;
		An assassination of noblemen on a truly magnificent scale!</p>

		<p>Nothing appearing in Bedlow&#8217;s evidence to implicate Fenwick and
		Whitebread, and two witnesses being necessary to prove the charge, they
		were sent back to prison. When they were subsequently brought up
		for trial for the same offence, and pleaded that they could not a second
		time be tried, their plea was overruled, although founded on one of the
		commonest principles of law, and sanctioned by a thousand precedents.
		The reasoning of Scroggs and North, the Chief Justice of the Common
		Pleas, is so curious that it is worth quoting. Whitebread, after objecting
		that he is informed that no man can be put in jeopardy of his life
		the second time for the same cause: &#8216;I speak it not for my sake only,
		but for the sake of the whole nation; no man should be tried twice for
		the same cause; by the same reason a man may be tried twenty or
		one hundred times.&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Scroggs</span>. &#8216;You say well, it is observed, Mr. Whitebread; but you
		must know that you were not put in jeopardy of your life for the same
		thing, for first the jury were discharged of you; it is true, it was supposed
		when you were indicted that there would be two witnesses against
		<a class="pagenum" id="page458" title="458"></a>you, but that fell out otherwise, and the law of the land requiring two
		witnesses to prove you guilty of treason, it was thought reasonable that
		you should not be put upon the jury at all, but you were discharged, and
		then you were in no jeopardy of your life.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Under favor, my lord, I was in jeopardy, for I was given in charge
		to the jury; and &#8217;tis the case in Seyer, 31 Eliz., he was indicted for a
		burglary committed the 31st of August, and pleaded to it, and afterward
		another indictment was preferred, and all the judges did declare that he
		could not be indicted the second time for the same fact, because he was
		in jeopardy of his life again.&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">C. J. North</span>. &#8216;The oath the jury take is, <em>that they shall well and
		truly try, and true deliverance make</em> of such prisoners as they shall have
		in charge; the charge of the jury is not full &#8216;till the court give them a
		a charge at last, after evidence had; and because there was a mistake
		in your case, that the evidence was not so full as might be, the jury before
		they ever considered concerning you at all they were discharged,
		and so you were not in jeopardy; and, I in my experience, know it to be
		often done, and &#8217;tis the course of law.&#8217;</p>

		<p>In this opinion all the judges coincided. Sad indeed was the condition
		of things in poor England when all her judges could resort to such
		miserable quibbles; or worse than this, could deliberately falsify the
		law, to condemn to an ignominious death two defenceless prisoners!</p>

		<p>To return from this digression. The three remaining prisoners were
		found guilty. The Chief Justice in charging the jury was even more
		violent against the Papists than in his charge at Coleman&#8217;s trial: &#8216;Some
		hold that the pope in council is infallible; and ask any Popish Jesuit of
		them all and he will say the pope is himself infallible in council or he
		is no true Jesuit; and if so, whatever they command is to be justified by
		their authority; so that if they give a dispensation to kill a king, that
		king is well killed. They indulge all sorts of sins, and no human bonds
		can hold them.</p>

		<p>&#8216;They have some parts of the foundation &#8217;tis true, but they are adulterated
		and mixed with horrid principles and impious practises. They
		eat their God, they kill their king, and saint the murderer. This is a
		religion that quite unhinges all piety, all morality, all conversation, and
		to be abominated by all mankind.</p>

		<p>&#8216;I return now to the fact which is proved by two witnesses, and by
		the concurrent evidence of the letter and the maid; and the matter is as
		plain and notorious as can be, that there was an intention of bringing in
		popery by a cruel and bloody way; for I believe they never could have
		prayed us into their religion. I leave it therefore for you to consider
		whether you have not as much evidence from these two men as can be
		expected in a case of this nature; and whether Mr. Oates be not rather
		justified by the testimony offered against him, than discredited. Let
		prudence and conscience direct your verdict, and you will be too hard
		for their art and cunning.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Gentlemen, if you think you shall be in long we will adjourn the
		court till the afternoon and take your verdict then.&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Jury</span>. &#8216;No, my lord, we shall not be long.&#8217;</p>

		<p>After a very short recess the jury returned with a verdict of guilty
		against all.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page459" title="459"></a>C. J. &#8216;You have done, gentlemen, like very good subjects and very
		good Christians; that is to say, like very good Protestants. And now,
		much good may their thirty thousand masses do them!&#8217;</p>

		<p>Before the court pronounced sentence Ireland loudly complained that
		he had had no time to call his witnesses: &#8216;So that we could have none
		but only those that came in by chance, and those things they have declared,
		though true, were not believed.&#8217; His objection was overruled,
		and the Recorder, Sir George Jeffries, proceeded to pass sentence. The
		spirit that pervaded his speech may be seen in this extract: &#8216;I am sure
		this was so horrid a design, that nothing but a conclave of devils in hell,
		or a college of such Jesuits as yours on earth, could have thought
		upon.&#8217;</p>

		<p>At the trial of Berry, Green and Hill, for the murder of Sir Edmondbury
		Godfrey, the improbabilities of the testimony and the contradictions
		of the witnesses were so glaring that it seems incredible that any
		man could believe them. As a specimen: Praunce, the chief witness,
		said that the body was taken to Hill&#8217;s lodgings where it remained two
		days in a certain room he mentioned. In defence, it was shown by all
		the family, that that room was an open one; that scarcely an hour
		passed but some one went through it. But instead of receiving this testimony,
		the Chief Justice told the witnesses that it was very suspicious
		they had not seen the body, and that it was well for them they were not
		indicted. But we have not space to quote further. The extracts we
		have already made will be sufficient to show Scrogg&#8217;s utter contempt
		for those duties which the law imposed upon him as the counsel for the
		prisoners; his abusive and threatening demeanor toward their witnesses;
		his appeals to the passions of the jury, their bigotry and their fears; and
		in a word, his total destitution of every quality that marks the honest,
		fair-minded, and impartial judge.</p>

		<p>We intended to speak of the disgraceful and cowardly part which
		Charles the Second bore in these proceedings. Convinced that the Plot
		was a mere fiction, he saw day by day his innocent and faithful subjects
		led to the gallows without making an effort for their safety, or
		giving utterance to a word of disapprobation. It was not until the
		Queen was attacked, that the selfish monarch interfered. A word from
		him turned the abuse of Scroggs into an opposite channel, and Oates
		and Bedlow were now as bitterly reviled as the Jesuits had been before.
		We believe that Charles was a willing spectator if not an active promoter
		of these legal butcheries, hoping that thereby a vent would be given
		to the popular fury, and he himself, by such a sacrifice, regain the lost
		affections of his people.</p>

		<p>We intended also to speak of the conduct of the leading English
		statesmen during this period; of Lauderdale, of Shaftsbury, of Danby,
		and of Buckingham; but our limits are already overpassed.
		We can only say that the character of the monarch was truly reflected
		in the character of his counsellors; that as England has
		never had so faithless and profligate a king, she has never been disgraced
		by such unscrupulous, despicable, and short-sighted ministers.</p>

		<p class="subtitle">VEL ISAACUS WALTON IN NOVAM SCALAM REDIVIVUS.</p>

		<p class="byline">BY PETER VON GEIST.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. <span class="first_word">You</span> are happily met, my fair young lady!</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. A very good morrow to you, Mr. <span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. You are
		early a-foot, with your rod and lines.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. A veteran of the angle will be stirring early; there is a
		brace of fish waiting for my hook on the other side of our lake. But
		you, my gentle maiden, have you come down to the beach to see the
		sun rise? and mayhap to pluck a rose with the dew on&#8217;t? I think you
		have found it; for I think I can see the rose on your cheek, and the
		dew in your eye. It is sweet to be up betimes in the morning, when
		the air and the new sunlight are as clear and calm as your own
		thoughts.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. It is even so, as you and I know right well. A pleasant
		sail to you; God send a dozen fish, and may you kill them merrily.
		But honest Mr. Piscator, do you go alone to-day?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. I think so to do; for you are to note, a companion of patience
		and sober demeanor, free from profane jests and scurrilous discourse,
		is worth gold, but is not so easy to be come at. And none other
		than such jumps with my humor.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. And when, my good Mr. Piscator, will you give me another
		lesson in the art of angling? For you must know the last has only
		increased my desire to learn something more of it. Or do you think
		that we women can never attain skill in that noble and gentle art?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. That it is a noble and a gentle art I am ready to maintain;
		and that women have attained skill in it is not to be doubted; as
		you will read in books of old time, that ladies both hunted, and hawked,
		and fished.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. But the lesson, my honest master? When shall I have
		another lesson?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. You shall even suit your own convenience. And some
		fine morning, when you are so disposed, we will take a walk down the
		river; when I will teach you to cast your line for trout; for indeed, it
		requires a sharp wit and much practice to throw your fly so that the
		trout will rise at it.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Not in the river, if it please you, good Mr. Piscator, not
		in the river! Teach me to fish in the lake.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. Without doubt, my fair young lady, it must be as you
		desire. And yet, it is not every woman that would have the courage to
		cross the pond in a skiff that rocks to every ripple.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Trust me for that. You should know that I am not
		wont to be frightened at trifles.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. Truly, it is so; and I do not question your courage.
		<a class="pagenum" id="page462" title="462"></a>Then on any day that you will appoint, <span class="special_name">God</span> willing, I will give you a
		sail; or indeed, this morning, if duty does not incline you in another
		direction, and you will step with me into my little boat yonder.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. That shall I with right good will. But I shall have to
		make you wait while I get my fishing tackle.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. Of necessity you shall not do that; for I remember now,
		I can fit you with a spare harness of my own.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Then let us be going, say I. And is this the skiff?
		What a painted little cockle-shell of a boat, with its two masts! I suppose
		it will bear us both?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. It will bear twenty like you and me. Please let me help
		you to step in; and though you feel it to give under your feet, and as it
		were, slide away from beneath you, yet now when you are set down on
		the bench, you perceive it is perfectly steady.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Oh, I shall not be in the least afraid. What a tiny little
		schooner! But is it not bold to spread both sails? And see, now
		that we come round to the wind, how the skiff keels over.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. It is entirely safe, my fair scholar; for since you have
		chosen me to be your instructor and master in the science of the angle,
		you must be content to be called my scholar. It is entirely safe; and
		you must observe, that however much it may keel over, it cannot upset;
		for if struck by a sudden squall, or flaw of the wind, the masts will go
		by the board, and so it will right.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Excellently well contrived. But has not the breeze suddenly
		died away? Yet the sails are distended, and miniature waves
		are thrown off from either side of the bow.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. The breeze seems to have decreased, because we are
		moving in the same direction with it; and you will see, now when I
		bring the boat more toward the wind, that it blows as strong as before,
		and our motion is well nigh stopped.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. That I can very well see; and I pray you, my master,
		not to bring the skiff so far into the wind to prove your proposition to me
		as to capsize it. The masts bend over toward the water more than it is
		pleasant to see.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. There is no danger; and after half an hour&#8217;s experience
		you will become used to it, and lose all apprehension. I think I will
		alter our course a couple of points; so if you have a mind, since I
		cannot well leave the tiller, you may unloose the cord that fastens the
		forward sail to the side of the boat; wait a moment till we come round,
		and the sail hangs loose in the wind; now loose the rope, and let it out
		about a foot; so, wind it round as it was before. Neatly done! Next,
		let out the other sail in the same way and to the same length. It was
		well executed! Really, you are destined to become a sailor&#8217;s wife
		after all.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Marry, I hope so. But why &#8216;after all?&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. Nay, I meant nothing; except, that whereas I formerly
		thought you rather affected the land, now I find that you are courageous
		on the water; and therefore, I say you deserve a Commodore. Observe
		now, we are running more nearly with the wind, and move faster.
		It is a favorable breeze; for our fishing-ground is in the south-eastern
		<a class="pagenum" id="page463" title="463"></a>corner of the lake, behind that highland which you see yonder; and this
		blows from the western quarter. We shall soon be there.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Be in no hurry; I am in none. Is it not a fine morning?
		Those white, high-flying clouds, rolled up into fleeces like wool, with
		ragged patches of the sky between them, above us, and the broad blue
		bosom of the lake, with the multitude of little waves leaping up and
		dancing all over its surface beneath us, and our boat, in the midst of
		both sky and water, gliding calmly along like a bird with his wings
		spread floating in the air! Is it not a lovely morning? Yes, yes; I
		must be a sailor&#8217;s wife, and live on the ocean! Or perhaps, rather, a
		fisherman&#8217;s wife, and sail on a lake like this. If I should happen to
		meet with one of the latter class, of approved character, somewhat mature
		in years and grave in demeanor, kind of disposition and manly of
		countenance, one who would let me go sailing with him every day, (of
		course I am not describing you, Mr. Piscator,) I think&#8212;yes, I am quite
		certain, that he would content me.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. Nay, nay, my fair young lady, you are pleased to mock!
		&#8216;Mature in years and grave in demeanor,&#8217; said you? A gallant young
		sailor for you, say I! There are many who sigh for the favor which
		you have so freely granted me to-day. Ah, you should not jeer.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. I tell you, Mr. Piscator, none but you for me this day!
		I am not going to think of any body but you; for I tell you plainly, I
		like you very much.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. Ah, yes, yes; certainly&#8212;without doubt, I hope so;
		surely, why should you not?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. And what a beautiful island! The grass grows down
		almost to the water&#8217;s edge, leaving a narrow belt of white sand; how
		it glistens in the sun-light! and those half-a-dozen tall trees in the centre,
		how do you suppose they came to grow there alone so?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. That is a question which I have often asked, but have
		never been able to satisfy myself, as to how they came there. They
		have stood for more generations than one, and will cast their shadows
		on the water when other boats than ours sail past them, and other eyes
		than ours wonder at them. Now we are nearly at our journey&#8217;s end;
		when we pass through the opening between that island ahead of us, and
		the main land, we shall be on our fishing-ground.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Is it possible that we have reached here so quick? It is
		not half so far as I thought it was. And yet, on looking back, there is
		a wide waste lying between us and the cove from which we started.
		How diminutive the house on the high ground back of the landing-place
		looks; like a mole-hill, and the trees around it like shrubs! Well sped,
		little bark! A swift and an easy-paced courser are you; steadily
		now, through this narrow strait; steadily and gently, for your race is
		almost run.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. The channel begins to widen again; and lo! here we
		are in a lake by itself as it were; a sheet of water full a mile long and
		a quarter of a mile wide. And herein the fish mostly do congregate. I
		will hold on to near the middle, and then drop the anchor.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. It is indeed a fine sheet; smooth as any mirror; clearer
		than glass. I suppose the fish assemble here when they get tired of the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page464" title="464"></a>roughness and commotion of the lake without, because it is so calm and
		still. Is it not so?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. It may be so; it is a good reason, and I will believe that
		it is so, since you have supposed it. This is as good a place as any,
		and here we will cast our lines; and there is so little wind stirring, that
		we shall only need to furl our sails, and the boat will remain at rest.
		Now then, here is your rod, nicely put together, with a fly on the hook.
		A pike will rise as quick at an artificial fly as at a live one; a greedy
		fish is that pike; and if we should have occasion, I have other kinds of
		bait. Take it, and throw your line out as I taught you before. But
		what are you regarding so intently?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. I am looking at the shadow of the trees in the water; an
		inverted forest in the lake. Fish a little while alone, and let me look.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. It has become so late in the day that I have not much
		hope of taking many now. However, I can but try. This same rod
		and line have done me good service in this same place, before to-day.
		Ah, I see a pike! I&#8217;ll have him! Look! look how slowly and warily
		he comes up toward the bait! When he gets within a few feet of it, he
		will make a dash, and gorge it without stopping to think. Ah, there he
		goes with it; and here he comes back with it, straight up into the boat.
		Upon my word, a reasonable fish; he wont weigh short of three pounds.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Oh, Mr. Piscator! here&#8217;s a new heaven and a new earth
		beneath us! Waving trees with birds flitting among their branches,
		and far down below, flying clouds and blue sky. A perfect hemisphere,
		and we are hanging over it, without any thing to support us! I
		shouldn&#8217;t be surprised, to feel myself this minute tumbling down into it,
		down to the new heaven! I have been expecting to, for some time past;
		and what a fall would that be! Do you suppose we should stop when
		we got there?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. If we did not, where should we go to?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Ah, where!</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. These fish do not seem inclined to bite this morning.
		Yet there is one larger than that I caught before. I must have him,
		too. Observe how wistfully he eyes the bait; let the fly skim slowly
		along the water, just over him; that is the way, Sir, to swallow a hook;
		and now come up, and slide into the basket, out of sight, and keep your
		brother company.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Mr. Piscator, when you make such a splashing in the
		water, you ruffle and wrinkle my submarine prospect. Please don&#8217;t.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. I think it will be profitless trying to take any more this
		forenoon; toward night they will bite again. And what shall we do in
		the mean time? Usually, when I come out here alone, I go ashore, and
		rest myself during these hours, amid the fragrant shades of the thick
		trees, that screen me from the mid-day heat. Would you like to take
		such a ramble?&#8212;or are you inclined to stay here, and gaze into the water?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. I suppose the picture will keep till we come back. Let
		us go ashore, and wander around in the woods, and find romantic grottoes,
		and weave flower-wreaths, and build castles in the air.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. And half a mile inland, you can see its summit from here,
		is a hill that commands a vast tract of lake and woodland.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page465" title="465"></a><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Yes, yes; let us go!</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. Well, scholar, here we are again, after our long tramp.
		You see I am a better land-pilot than you just now took me to be; for
		I have brought us out to the right spot; more by token, yonder is the
		boat, safe and sound. I am afraid you are fatigued with our long
		travels?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Not much; but I would like to sit down on the green
		carpet, under this shade, for a few minutes.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. It must be, at the least, four of the clock; and although
		your nature, my fair young lady, is probably too ethereal to think of
		such homely matters, I do not profess mine to be such, and am ready to
		acknowledge, that <em>a little dinner</em> would not be unacceptable.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Unacceptable? No; but where are we to get it?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. I always bring with me, on my excursions, a hand-basket,
		<span class="keep_together">containing&#8212;&#8212;</span></p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Why in the world!&#8212;why <em>didn&#8217;t</em> you let me know that
		before? Let us have it as quick as possible!</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. It is in the boat, and if you will remain a moment, I will
		bring it up here.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Oh yes, do! And be quick, my good master!&#8212;as
		quick as you can!</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. Nimble as any page, that waits on lady bright. Here
		we have the provisions; and if we could manage to find something for
		a table-cover, we might dispense with knives <span class="keep_together">and&#8212;&#8212;</span> Right, scholar,
		put your hand into the basket and help yourself.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Ham sandwich! Oh, Mr. Piscator, this is good! Is
		there enough of it?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. Enough for us two; and therefore you need not fear to
		help yourself heartily, as I am glad to see that you are not. Never was
		sumptuous feast to an epicure on gala-day better than my simple fare
		to me on this beach, after a morning&#8217;s sail and ramble.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Most excellent! I&#8217;ll come out here every time I can
		get a chance, for the sake of dining with you under the old beech tree.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. It brings to my mind the story of the king, who, after
		the chase, took some bread and water at the hut of a woodsman; which,
		as it is no doubt well known, I shall not repeat unto you. But the bottom
		of the basket begins to appear. What! done already? Good
		despatch! And now, scholar, we will immediately to our sport, for we
		have no time to waste.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Yes, yes, immediately to work; I long to try my hand.
		Here&#8217;s the boat; I should think it would have got tired waiting so long
		for us. But it looks very patient.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. You may get in, while I loose, and shove off. There
		appears to be a sharp breeze blowing on the lake without, yet our pond
		is as unruffled as when we left it. We will return to the same spot we
		were in before, and cast out our lines.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Is this my rod? Fix the bait for me skilfully, and I&#8217;ll
		catch them.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. I cannot promise you great success at first, considering
		your <span class="keep_together">inexperience&#8212;&#8212;</span></p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page466" title="466"></a><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Oh, I&#8217;m going to catch an hundred!</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. I hope you may; certainly&#8212;I hope you will; and you
		can only try. There, your fly is fastened to the hook as well as my art
		is able. Come, and sit on this side, and I will give you some instructions
		how to use it. First, see that the line is clear of the rod; then
		give it one swing round your head; so&#8212;and cast it quickly but softly,
		as far from you as you can on the water. Neatly done! Now draw
		it slowly along the surface, and you shall presently see a fish rise at it.
		Be more moderate; you draw it too rapidly. Ha! there it goes under!
		Wait till you feel him pulling on the line; now give him a little jerk
		to the right; there you have him, fairly hooked! You must be careful,
		or you&#8217;ll lose him yet. No; he&#8217;s not very heavy, and you may raise
		him strait out of the water, and land him in the boat; so!</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Ah, my master, will you tell me that I can&#8217;t catch fish?
		Poor little fish! Oh, but he&#8217;s a small one: take him off, master, and
		put him into the hold. I hunt for nobler game.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. Not a good thought, not a good thought for an angler.
		Hunt for nobler game, if you like; but a fisherwoman must not despise
		the smallest that comes to her net. Every thing counts.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Despise? No; oh no! I would like to catch fifty just
		such; that is, if there are no larger ones to angle for.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. Well, your bait is set again. Cast out as before, and I
		wish you better luck.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Now I am going to catch a large one&#8212;a foot long.
		But, Mr. Piscator, why do you not use your line?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. I will not interfere with your sport; and beside, I may
		want to give you advice how to manage yours. It is not, in general, a
		good plan to let the fish see you when you are angling; they are apt to
		be frightened away. However, in this case, I shall say nothing against
		it; because if they have an eye for beauty, as is commonly believed,
		your showing yourself should have a contrary effect. In truth, the influence
		of beauty is much to be marvelled at. I remember myself when
		I was young, and had not yet learned their vanity, how easy I was to be
		led away and bewitched by a fair face and a sparkling eye. That was
		some time ago; you draw your fly too fast; it was some years ago;
		and yet I am fain to confess, that even now, in nothing do I take more
		pleasure, than in looking on a ruddy cheek, a polished brow, the long
		lashes of a soft blue eye, and upon heavy folds of auburn hair; and it
		is for this reason that I have placed you opposite to me now.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Why, Mr. Piscator! Did you mean that for a compliment?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. Certainly no. I seldom speak but what I think, for flattery
		I like neither to give nor receive. Ah, yes; there are witches in
		the world yet. And their witchcraft consists not in magic filters, and
		potent herbs gathered at midnight under the full moon; far more subtle
		and powerful is it. Like the poisons of eastern countries, it is communicated
		by a touch, by a look, by the breath of a word. This is the
		witchcraft that they use; therewith lure they men to commit folly. It
		would seem to be their chief delight, their main occupation. But I am
		willing to believe that you are not so evil-minded; and that when you
		<a class="pagenum" id="page467" title="467"></a>bewitch men, it is not because you love to do it, but that it is altogether
		involuntary.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Oh, of course, altogether involuntary. If I had my
		way, I never would cause a single flutter in any body&#8217;s breast&#8212;not I.
		But you see how it is, I can&#8217;t help it, and therefore it is not my fault.
		These fish do not bite well. There is one, he will weigh four pounds,
		that has been playing round and round the hook, but won&#8217;t touch it.
		Haven&#8217;t you got some kind of sweet smelling oil or perfume to scent
		the bait with?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. I have some lavender-leaves, and if you will draw up the
		line, I will rub the fly over with them, for fish love the smell of lavender.
		Try him with that. Ah, I see him&#8212;a respectable fish. He is
		coming up toward the hook; I think he will take it.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. He stops and eyes it, as though he half suspected that
		it would not be pleasant to the taste, for all its fair looks. But I&#8217;ll have
		him, in spite of his wits. You scrutinize too closely, Sir Pike! You
		had better take it at once, without useless inspection. What a noble
		fellow! How gracefully he moves through the water! I will make it
		float carelessly away from him, dancing on the silver surface, as though
		it had just fallen fresh from Heaven; and beside, distance lends enchantment.
		Ha! see him make a dive at it! There you have it, Sir!
		and there I have you!</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. Take care, or you&#8217;ll be over! Hold hard, or he&#8217;ll have
		<em>you</em> too! Upon my word, I was afraid you would go overboard! You
		should not, in your eagerness, lean out over the water so far. But you
		have got the better of him, and now pull him into the boat and let me
		take him off.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. I came near losing my balance; I thought I was gone!
		Lucky escape!&#8212;but my heart beats yet.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. A fine fish. He has swallowed the bait whole; your
		large fish always do. O! I don&#8217;t know as I can take it out, without
		hurting him.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Poor fish! He does not look quite so spruce and independent
		as he did a little while ago. Did your mouth water for that
		tempting fly. It will never water again! What deep sighs heave his
		little breast! but they will soon be over. Fix the bait, Mr. Piscator,
		and rub some more lavender on it. I&#8217;ll catch another, in less than a
		minute.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. It is done already. And this time, do not lean over so
		far, or you will be in danger of being pulled in, by some fish of greater
		strength than usual. Really, I think you are a good angler; you seem
		to possess the skill by intuition. Is it not fine sport? I see by the increased
		flush and light of your countenance, that you are of the same
		opinion. It is truly a gentle, a feminine sport.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. There is one with the beautifulest eyes, and covered all
		over with gold and silver. But he is exceedingly shy. Come, Sir, if
		you are so distant, I shall have to approach you myself. I desire a
		nearer acquaintance with your beautiful eyes, and your gold and silver
		scales. Oh! if you move off in that direction, I shall retire in this!
		Ah, you&#8217;ve thought better of it, and are coming back. I knew you
		<a class="pagenum" id="page468" title="468"></a>would. Observe, Mr. Piscator, how he turns round and hesitates and
		doubts what to do. There is no use in his deliberating; it is inevitable;
		he has got to do it. Now he turns back. He seems to have made up
		his mind that he must have it at all hazards. And see him shut his
		eyes and make a dash. I am afraid he finds it unpalatable! Too rash!
		too rash! You should have considered better! Take him off, master;
		he is nothing very great, after all.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. I see a large one, lying here at the left, deep in the water;
		of the kind which we call sucker. It is his nature to lie perfectly still
		as though asleep, and not to move till he is touched. Reach here the
		hook, while I fasten some pieces of lead to it, enough to sink it; and
		then I will tell you how to hook him.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. I see! I know! I can do it myself, I will let the bait
		sink gently down into the water, a little forward of him, thus. Ah, it
		fell right on his back! He must be asleep, for he doesn&#8217;t stir, nor seem
		to notice it. Now then, a little forward of him; and so, slowly, softly,
		float up toward his nose. He appears to be inspecting the fly; he
		sleeps with his mouth wide open; as a natural history philosopher might
		examine a butterfly; and since it is so closely presented, suppose you
		try the sense of taste too, Sir! It is pleasant to the eye, you will find
		it also good for food, and to be desired to make one wise. Allow it to
		fall imperceptibly into your mouth; nay, you cannot judge of its merits
		from a half trial, like that; it must be taken entirely in. Don&#8217;t exert
		yourself, in the least; another inspiration, and you are possessed. Ha!
		is it not good?&#8212;is it not sweet? He must be very fond of it, he holds
		on to it so hard! Astonished fish! he wakes up, and opens his eyes
		with wonder; there is more in it than he dreamed of! Strait up to the
		light here, and show your agitated countenance. Now please to open
		your lips, and disclose the cause of all your sorrows, while kind Mr.
		Piscator extracts it.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. Well hooked! Indeed, scholar, it was well done of you.
		But the heavens are becoming overcast; it threatens storm. Would it
		not be wise to set out on our return?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Oh no, no! I can&#8217;t think of going yet? &#8216;Wise!&#8217; It seems
		to me that it would be very foolish, while the lake contains so many
		more fish as good as any that we have already caught.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. You do not expect to take them all?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. All in this place; what should hinder?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. They will not bite for ever in the same place. They are
		a cunning animal, and get frightened.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Then let us remove to another spot.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. That we might do, if there were time; but the sun is entirely
		hidden by clouds, and is near his going down. We shall presently
		have a thunder-storm. And then a stiff breeze from the south, which
		will waft us speedily toward our landing place; had we not better begin
		to think of leaving?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Wait till I catch one fish more; I had a nibble just then.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. You should handle your rod more gently. The wind
		blows up fresher and fresher; it will be dark as pitch too, when night
		<a class="pagenum" id="page469" title="469"></a>fairly comes on. Shall we not spread our sails, and speed merrily
		homeward?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Well, as you will, master; though really I don&#8217;t see
		any occasion for all this hurry. Look at that fish! He rose almost to
		the surface after my hook, and yet wouldn&#8217;t take it. Oh, my poor fly!
		my poor bait! See it, master! All faded and worn and torn, no painting
		or patching can renew its comeliness! And there sticks out the
		hook, plain to view; a blind fish might see it! Oh, my poor fly, that
		couldn&#8217;t conceal the hook any longer! Mr. Piscator, lend me your
		knife, while I cut the bait from the line, rags, paint, iron and all, and
		throw it back into the water, thus. Now then, little fish! silly fish!
		come all of you, and see what has befooled you! What some of your
		tribe have swallowed because they thought it was good, and some because
		they were careless, and others because they were hungry and
		must have something! What many of ye have taken in, and more
		have nibbled at, and all have gazed at, and admired and longed for!
		Oh, rare sport have ye made me, foolish things! And longer would I
		have played with you, but the evening comes on, and I must bid you
		a happy farewell. So we are under way again, are we?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. We are again under way; and I have hope of reaching
		home before yonder cloud comes over us. And trust me, when it does
		come, it will bring more wind with it.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Once more on the open bosom of the lake! How the
		little black angry waves dance up one after another, and roll past us
		toward the northern shore. And see that dim hill at the other extremity
		of the pond, how gigantic and broken it looks. Oh, Mr. Piscator, let&#8217;s
		go and see it! let&#8217;s go and see it! And those high perpendicular rocks,
		that stand out so boldly. Yes, yes, put up the helm! we&#8217;ll go and see
		how they look in the twilight.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. But my dear child, it will take an hour and a half longer
		to go round by the rocks, and before that time, I fear the storm will increase.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Oh, never fear the storm. I&#8217;ll risk it! And when we
		get up there, we can take a short cut across to our port; so put up the
		helm!&#8212;good Mr. Piscator, kind Mr. Piscator! do let us run up to the
		hill! I can assure you there is no danger.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. I cannot well deny any thing that you ask of me; but
		much I doubt, <span class="keep_together">Mr. &#8212;&#8212;</span></p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Nay, nay, doubt nothing. We shall get home safe,
		trust me for that. And that cloud, that you are so fearful of, is not
		coming over us, at all; it is coming down on the other shore of the lake.
		Please, Mr. Pilot, to keep in a little nearer the land, or we shall pass the
		rocks so far out, that we shall not be able to see them with distinctness.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. A wilful woman must even have her own way. My
		child! you will catch your death with cold, to take off your bonnet so!</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. I&#8217;m not afraid of it; I want to feel the air.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. And where are you going now?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Going to sit down in the bow of the boat. This view is
		much finer! Oh, this is grand!</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page470" title="470"></a><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. But, good scholar! good scholar! you will certainly fall
		out there! I believe you are crazy, you look so wild!</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. How the boat pitches over the little waves! And, Mr.
		Piscator, direct the boat toward the shore, so as to make it rock more.
		The heavens are all grey, and the waters are all black, and the wind is
		high and wild in its sport like an imprisoned bird let loose. Oh master,
		spread the other sail, and see if we can&#8217;t fly faster! Here are the rocks
		so grim; but it is growing dark, and I can only just make them out.
		Why, Mr. Piscator, you are not going near enough! Run close in under
		them!</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. I shall say to you plainly, what you ask is impossible.
		It would be running an unwarrantable hazard; as indeed coming up
		here at all was unwarrantable.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. At least then, good master, keep along up at this distance,
		if that pleases you best; for there is a bluff just ahead, which projects
		farther out than the others, and we shall pass close by it.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. It is high time that we commenced our return in good
		earnest. And therefore, scholar, for I must remind you that you are my
		scholar till I see you safe ashore; therefore, if you please, you may
		stand by the sail to tack.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. But just look once, how boldly and sternly it lifts up its
		calm front out of the boiling waters!</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. It is without doubt, very fine; but it is impossible to hold
		on a foot farther. So if you will stand by the <span class="keep_together">sail&#8212;&#8212;</span></p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. I wish I had a boat of my own to sail out here alone in
		and go where I choose! Well, what shall I do? how shall I go to work?
		Oh, Mr. Piscator! honest Mr. Piscator! let me hold the helm while you
		take care of the sails.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. Willingly, if your hand is strong enough. Try it; shall
		you be able to hold it as it is?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. With the greatest ease. Now then, are you ready?
		What are you letting down the sail for? That three-cornered rag from
		the bow-sprit wont be enough!</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. It would be unsafe to set the main-sail, and I think with
		this breeze the fore-stay-sail will drive us sufficiently fast.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Well, suit yourself. Now are you ready?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. Ready, certainly, when I take the helm. But what are
		you doing? If you undertake to let the skiff fall off before the wind
		you will upset us, as sure <span class="keep_together">as&#8212;&#8212;</span></p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Just see if I do. Let me hold the helm. Oh yes, let
		me!</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. But scholar! good scholar! dear scholar!</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. No, no, I wont give it up! you can&#8217;t have it! Honest
		Mr. Piscator, let me steer the boat, only a little way! Oh, but I will;
		and there is no use in your trying to prevent me. See there now,
		haven&#8217;t we come round to our course in good style?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. A taste of power to those who are unaccustomed to it is
		always dangerous, and I blame myself for permitting you to usurp the
		post of pilot. Though, as you seem determined to maintain it, I cannot
		choose but to sit down here quietly, and trust our lives to your skill.
		<a class="pagenum" id="page471" title="471"></a>My life indeed! But yours? Seriously now, my fair young lady,
		would it not be <span class="keep_together">wiser&#8212;&#8212;</span></p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Seriously now, my careful master, I don&#8217;t think it would.
		Why, what would you have? Are we not skimming over the waves
		like a sea-bird free? And see those two birds, how they dash by us,
		and wheel round over us, and breast the gale! Oh master! wouldn&#8217;t
		you like to be a sea-bird, and swing sideways, with your face to the
		wind that almost took your breath away, swing down, down, glance
		against the water, then on the other side, swing up, up? And wouldn&#8217;t
		it be sweet too to struggle your way up through the storm, high over
		that cloud yonder, with the thunder on its inside and the lightning on its
		out&#8212;then fold your wings, close your eyes, and fall calmly down on
		to its dark, soft, bosom? Oh, wouldn&#8217;t it be sweet?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. My dear scholar, our landing place lies here, toward the
		north-east, and you are running directly north.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Don&#8217;t be under any apprehensions; I am only going to
		run out half a mile farther, that we may get before the wind, and then
		we&#8217;ll scud straight toward home. And beside, we rock more, going in
		this direction. I wish it would blow harder, and make more swell!
		You know now, Mr. Piscator, how a wild swan feels when he sits on the
		water and is buoyed up on the heaving wave, and in a breath sinks into
		the black abyss. If I were a wild swan I would go to sleep and let
		the winds blow and the waters heave! How the boat careens over and
		plunges down when the blast whistles against the masts! Drive on!
		Drive on! my light gallant bark! Oh, my master! shall I sing you
		a song? a little song of the sea? a pirate song?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. You look at this present moment as if you might sing a
		pirate song, or be a pirate yourself. I observe that since you have taken
		off your bonnet, the wind has somewhat disarranged your hair.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Wouldn&#8217;t you like to be a pirate, though? I would;
		and roam over the ocean at my own free will; and through the storm
		and spray, and lightning-glances of the wild midnight, dash on my fleeing
		victim like the eagle on his prey! All hands on deck to get on
		more sail! Stand by to unfurl the main-sail to the tempest!</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. Will it please you, my fair pilot, to inform me whither
		you are taking us?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. I am going to run into that cloud yonder; the one before
		us, with the thunder on its inside and the lightning on its out.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. What you call a cloud appears to me to be a hill, that
		rises a few rods back from the shore.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Oh, it&#8217;s a cloud&#8212;a cloud! And there is a star that
		glimmers through it.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. I see nothing but the twinkling of a taper, from the window
		of some dwelling.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. I tell you it&#8217;s a star&#8212;a star! The cloud has settled
		down into the water like a mountain; and through its base penetrates a
		tunnel, through which the ray of that star comes&#8212;a long, straight
		cavern, arched overhead and on either side by wreathed and rolling
		pillars of smoke. I&#8217;ll put up the helm and run into it! Bear up! bear
		up! bear stoutly up, my brave, bold bark! and plunge forward like the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page472" title="472"></a>horse into the smoke of battle, through this path to the subterranean
		abodes!</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. Let me take the tiller! Let it go! Put it around quick
		then; you are running on the beach!</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Why don&#8217;t you see we are just entering the dark mouth
		of the tunnel? We shall soon be into it.</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. Hark! here it comes! Now hold hard, for there we are,
		grounded and staved!</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Tartarian rocks and whirlpools!</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. Quick! ashore! The boat is going to pieces!</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Discipula</span>. Ha! ha! ha! Was it well done, my master? was it
		well done?</p>

		<p><span class="special_name">Piscator</span>. It <em>was</em> well done, you little water-witch!</p>

		<h3 class="subtitle fancy">Harry Harson.</h3>

		<h4 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER XXVI.</h4>

		<p><span class="first_word">At</span> the dead of the night, when all others were at rest, Michael Rust
		glided out of his office. It was a strange hour, but he had become a
		strange man. Through the silent streets he stole, with a step so noiseless
		that it awoke no echo. Along Broadway, passing where the city
		ended and the fields began, mile after mile he went. He met no one.
		Every house that he passed was as silent as the grave; excepting a
		solitary one, standing by itself, with a light shining through an upper
		window, as if some one kept watch at a sick bed. Sometimes the road
		ran between high trees, whose skeleton outlines stood grimly up between
		him and the stars, stiff and motionless. At other times, it coursed
		along dreary wastes; then again, it was buried in dense shadow; now
		ascending, now descending. At times he caught a glimpse of the distant
		gray river, gleaming in the darkness, with here and there the light on
		board some vessel at anchor, glittering like a star. In some places,
		where it was shut in by high banks, the road seemed inky black; and
		parts of it were so solitary, that even a stout heart might have shrunk
		from traversing it at that dreary hour. But Rust thought not of fear.
		What had <em>he</em> to do with that feeling, who sought only revenge and a
		grave?</p>

		<p>It was yet night, when he reached a house in the upper part of the
		island, and near the river. Little except its dim outline was visible in
		the obscurity; and as he opened the gate, and passed beneath an avenue
		of tall trees which led to it, the darkness was such that he could scarcely
		see. But he was familiar with the ground, and without hesitation went
		directly to the door of the house. It was locked. He drew a key from
		his pocket, unlocked it, went in, and closed it after him. He groped
		his way along the entry, until he came to the door of a room, which he
		opened. A few embers were smouldering on the hearth, sufficient to
		throw out a dim light. Lighting a candle, which stood on a table, he
		drew a chair to the fire and sat down. The chamber was large, fitted
		up as a library, and filled with massive book-cases of dark wood, elaborately
		carved, which gave a sombre appearance to the room. Nothing
		that money could buy had been spared; for this was the home of Rust&#8217;s
		daughter, and that hard, reckless, griping man had been alive but to
		one feeling&#8212;love to his child. In <em>her</em> were garnered up all his affections,
		and upon her he had lavished all that his means could obtain.</p>

		<p>For a long time he sat without changing his position, his eye fixed,
		his mouth compressed, his brow knit, not a sound escaping him. At
		last he started from his fit of abstraction, with a slight shiver; passed
		<a class="pagenum" id="page474" title="474"><!-- original reads 484 --></a>his hand once or twice before his eyes, as if to dispel something that
		clouded his sight; and said, in a whisper. &#8216;Can all this be real?&#8217; The
		clock struck three. He rose, cast a stealthy glance over his shoulder,
		and taking the candle in his hand, held it up over his head, examining
		the room with a suspicious look, as if he momentarily expected some
		form to start from behind the heavy furniture. As his eye was wandering
		round the room, it rested upon a picture in a carved frame, which
		hung against the wall. He went to it, and held the light so that its
		rays fell full upon it. It was the portrait of a girl of about seventeen.
		Could the child-like, innocent face which gazed out from the canvass
		upon that fierce, passion-worn old man, be that of <em>his</em> child? Could
		aught so pure and beautiful have sprung from such as him? And worse
		than all, could she have lost that purity which was stamped on every
		line of her face?</p>

		<p>With fixed and rigid features; with a hand that did not tremble, with
		a heart that scarcely beat, he contemplated the picture; and then,
		slowly, as if in a dream, replaced the candle, and took his seat. There
		was that at work within him, however, which banished bodily repose;
		for in one minute afterward, he was up and pacing the room, muttering
		and gesticulating to himself; the <em>next</em>, he went to a mirror, and looked
		at his own face. He started as he did so; for he had not seen it in a
		week; and in that time so altered and wasted had it become, with its
		long unshorn beard, and ghastly white complexion, that he could scarcely
		recognize it.</p>

		<p>&#8216;What a bird of prey the mind is!&#8217; muttered he; &#8216;how it devours the
		body!&#8217; He turned away, and once more his eye rested on the picture
		which hung against the wall. Some strange feeling seemed to spring
		into existence as he did so; for his breath came thick and hard; his
		heart beat, until its pulsations could be heard, loud and strong like the
		blows of a hammer; his hand shook, but at the same time, his brow
		darkened, and its look of anxious and half-wandering thought gave
		place to an expression that was perfectly fiendish. He muttered a few
		words; then taking the light, cautiously opened the door, and stole up
		the broad flight of stairs which led to the upper story. At the head
		of it was a door; he tried it; it was not locked but yielded to his push.
		It opened into a bed-room, luxuriously furnished with mirrors, and
		various nick-nacks, and articles of taste, such as a young and
		wealthy female gathers about her; and in the bed lay a beautiful girl,
		the original of the picture below, sound asleep, her long hair, which had
		become unbound as she slept, lying in loose tresses upon the pillow.
		How bright and beautiful she was! How gentle and calm her breathing
		was! And well might the stern old man, as he looked at her angel face,
		have misgivings as to the truth of Grosket&#8217;s tale. Rust&#8217;s hard features
		worked convulsively as he stood over his child, as if powerful feelings
		were tugging at his heart-strings; but it was only for a moment, for he
		choked them down; and going out, in the cautious manner in which he
		had entered, he closed the door and descended to the room below.</p>

		<p>He resumed his seat; and although hour after hour elapsed, until
		day-light stole in the room, his attitude remained the same; until a
		servant came in to light the fire, and uttered an exclamation of surprise
		<a class="pagenum" id="page475" title="475"><!-- original reads 485 --></a>at seeing him. This aroused him; and rising hastily, he said, &#8216;I&#8217;m
		going out. Tell your mistress that I&#8217;ll be here at ten o&#8217;clock.&#8217; He
		left the house; and after wandering up and down the road, he crossed
		the fields, until he came to the edge of the river, and when he had
		sauntered along it for some time, he sat down upon a rock, and commenced
		casting pebbles in the water.</p>

		<p>How long a time he passed in this way, he could not tell, but it must
		have been several hours; for on looking at his watch, he found that
		it was late in the day. Suddenly, recollecting his message to his
		daughter; he rose and went directly to the house. He crossed the
		lawn in front of it; but before he had time to reach the door, a light
		figure sprang out, and his child&#8217;s arms were about his neck.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Dear father! it&#8217;s a very long time since I saw you!&#8217; said she, putting
		back the hair which hung over his face, and pressing her lips to
		his cheek. &#8216;I&#8217;m very happy at having you here once more. But you
		are ill&#8212;very ill! What ails you?&#8217; said she, suddenly, as she observed
		the inroads which the last few days had made in his whole form. Rust
		withdrew himself from her embrace, and without answering her question,
		said in a cold tone: &#8216;Come in the house.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Though his words were simple, there was that in his manner (or it
		might have been the consciousness of guilt on the part of the girl) which
		caused her cheek to grow pale, and her step to falter; and she accompanied
		him to the library, with the silent and downcast look of a criminal.
		He took a chair, drew it to the fire, and pointing to another, said
		in the same cold tone: &#8216;Be seated.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The girl obeyed without a word. At that moment a servant opened
		the door, and told Rust that a man was inquiring for him.</p>

		<p>Rust got up, and went out. In the entry were two men. One of
		them, a powerfully-built fellow, of about five-and-thirty, with light hair
		and a prominent eye, asked, &#8216;Are you Michael Rust?&#8217;</p>

		<p>Rust scanned him from head to foot. He suspected his errand; for
		he had seen him before, and he replied simply: &#8216;I am.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Then, Sir, we&#8217;ve come for you.&#8217; At the same time, the man produced
		a slip of paper, and tapped Rust on the shoulder. &#8216;Here&#8217;s the
		warrant, if you&#8217;d like to look at it, and the vehicle&#8217;s in the road there.&#8217;
		He gave a nod in the direction.</p>

		<p>Rust evinced neither surprise nor trepidation. He merely said, in a
		musing tone, &#8216;I should have stipulated for a longer time, for the lawyer
		has lost none.&#8217; Then addressing the officer, he added: &#8216;My daughter
		is in the room. Before going with you, I should like to speak with her
		in private. You may examine the room, to see that there are no means
		of escaping from it.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The man took him at his word; went in the room; glanced round
		without noticing the girl, who regarded him with some surprise; then
		went to an inner door, locked it, and put the key in his pocket.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Are you satisfied?&#8217; asked Rust.</p>

		<p>The other again stared round the room: went to the window; looked
		out to see how high it was from the ground; said that he was, and then
		inquired: &#8216;How long?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Ten minutes,&#8217; was the reply.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page476" title="476"><!-- original reads 486 --></a>&#8216;Good!&#8217; said the man; and with a knowing look at Rust, and a
		shambling bow to the girl, he went out, and seated himself on a chair
		in the hall, having taken the precaution to send his companion to keep
		an eye on the windows, which were within leap of the ground.</p>

		<p>Rust returned to his seat. &#8216;Come hither, Ellen,&#8217; said he.</p>

		<p>His daughter rose, and came to him; but in dead silence.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Look at me. Am I much altered?&#8217; inquired Rust.</p>

		<p>The girl raised her eyes to his. They quailed before his stern,
		searching glance; but she replied in a low voice: &#8216;You&#8217;re very much
		altered; you&#8217;re wearing yourself out.&#8217;</p>

		<p>A smile of strange meaning crossed Rust&#8217;s face. He turned, and
		pointed to the picture which hung against the wall.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Was that ever a good likeness of you?&#8217; asked he.</p>

		<p>His daughter glanced at it, with some surprise at the sudden question,
		and then replied: &#8216;I&#8217;ve often been told so, father&#8212;a very good
		one.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;They told you the truth. It <em>was</em> a good one; and now,&#8217; said he,
		turning to her, and fixing his eyes on her face: &#8216;Do you think I am as
		much changed from what <em>I</em> was, as you are from what <em>you</em> were, when
		that picture was painted? Mark it well!&#8217; said he, speaking quickly and
		earnestly, and leaning forward until his face almost touched hers.
		&#8216;Look at every feature. See what innocence, what purity of soul and
		thought is in every line of that face. An angel might have envied its
		innocence. There is a mirror,&#8217; said he, pointing to the looking-glass;
		&#8216;Now look at yourself.&#8217; He half rose, and his voice was cold and
		cutting as he concluded.</p>

		<p>The girl grew red; then deeper and deeper crimson; then deadly,
		ghastly pale; the perspiration stood upon her forehead, and her eyes
		were blinded with tears; but she could not meet his glance.</p>

		<p>His voice sank almost to a whisper, as he asked &#8216;Then what I have
		heard is true?&#8217;</p>

		<p>The girl seemed absolutely stunned.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Be it so. Now you know the cause of my illness. Look at me.
		Look at this face, scored with wrinkles; these hollow cheeks, and this
		frame, broken down by premature old age. Look at them, I say, and
		you will see but a faint image of the utter, hopeless waste that has
		been going on in my heart.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The girl made an attempt to speak; sank on the floor; and clasping
		his knees, pressed her head against them, and sobbed aloud. But Rust
		moved not. There was no trace of compassion in either tone or manner,
		as he continued: &#8216;From your childhood, until you were grown
		up, you were the person for whose welfare I toiled. I labored and
		strove for you; there was not a thing that I did, not a thought that I
		ever harbored, which had not your happiness for its aim; and to your
		love and devotion I looked for my reward; and as I brooded over my
		own guilty life, blackened as it was with the worst of crimes, I thought
		that it was some palliation to be the parent of one pure and spotless as
		you were. Well, you turned out as hundreds of others have done, and
		my labor was lost. I loved you as never child was loved; and in proportion
		as my love once was great, so now is my hate and scorn!&#8217;</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page477" title="477"><!-- original reads 487 --></a>&#8216;Oh! my God!&#8217; gasped the girl. She sank down as if crushed.
		Rust looked at her unmoved, and did not stir to assist her. She raised
		her hands to him, and said in a supplicating tone: &#8216;Father! as you
		hope for mercy, hear me!&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;If I received not mercy from my own child,&#8217; said Rust, sternly, &#8216;to
		whom can I look for it? I hope for it no where; I ask for it no where;
		I am at bay to the whole world.&#8217;</p>

		<p>One of those dark, withering expressions which had once been so
		common to his features, but which his anguish had for the last few
		days in a great measure banished from them, swept across his face.</p>

		<p>The girl wrung her hands, as she received his harsh answer. At last
		she said, in a broken voice: &#8216;Father, I am sadly guilty; but hear me,
		for <span class="special_name">God&#8217;s</span> sake, <em>do</em> hear me!&#8217;</p>

		<p>At that moment, the door was opened, and the officer&#8217;s head was
		thrust in.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Time&#8217;s up.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;I must have ten minutes more,&#8217; said Rust.</p>

		<p>&#8216;You can&#8217;t.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;I must, I <em>will</em>,&#8217; exclaimed Rust, sternly.</p>

		<p>He tossed him a dollar, which the man caught in his hand with professional
		dexterity; and then, with a grin, said: &#8216;Well, if you&#8217;re so
		very anxious, of course you must be accommodated;&#8217; and disappearing,
		shut the door.</p>

		<p>&#8216;You said that you were guilty,&#8217; resumed Rust, turning to his daughter.
		&#8216;I know it. There&#8217;s but one more so. You know to whom I
		allude. What is his name?&#8217;</p>

		<p>The girl grew very pale, and hung down her head in silence.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Who is he?&#8217; again demanded her father, seizing her arm with a
		strong grasp.</p>

		<p>Still she made no reply.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Be it so,&#8217; said Rust flinging her hand from him. &#8216;Perhaps silence
		is best. Now, one other question. <em>Where</em> is he?&#8217;</p>

		<p>She shook her head, and replied in a scarcely audible tone that she
		did not know.</p>

		<p>&#8216;When was he last here?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;About a week since.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;And when did he promise to return?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;On the same day,&#8217; answered the girl, in a low tone.</p>

		<p>&#8216;And he has not kept that promise. The first of a series of black-hearted
		lies!&#8217; exclaimed Rust, bitterly, speaking more to himself than to
		her. &#8216;In these cases, lies come first, and the truth last.&#8217; He again
		addressed her: &#8216;Does he speak of marriage? and do <em>you</em> urge it upon
		him?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;I <em>do</em>, indeed I <em>do</em>!&#8217; replied the girl, apparently anxious to hit upon
		something to conciliate the stern mood of her parent. &#8216;Often and often,
		I beg him to do it, and remind him of his promise.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;And what is his answer?&#8217; demanded Rust, with a half-mocking
		smile.</p>

		<p>&#8216;He says that he cannot marry me just now, but that he will soon.
		He wishes to obtain the consent of his father, who is very ill, and cannot
		<a class="pagenum" id="page478" title="478"><!-- original reads 488 --></a>be spoken to about it; but that he will soon be better, and that then
		it will all be settled.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;How long has he been making these excuses?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;A very long time&#8212;a very long time,&#8217; said the girl, sadly: &#8216;A
		month and more.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;How often did he come here at first?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Every day,&#8217; said the girl.</p>

		<p>&#8216;And now?&#8217;</p>

		<p>His daughter was silent; for she began to see the drift of this cold
		examination, and it sent a chill to her heart.</p>

		<p>Rust was satisfied; and he said in a half-musing tone: &#8216;The same
		stale, hackneyed story. She is on her way to where the first misstep
		always leads. Already he is wearied, and wants but an excuse to fling
		her off; and I&#8212;I&#8212;<em>I</em>&#8212;her avenger,&#8217; exclaimed he with a burst of
		fierce impatience, &#8216;<em>I</em> am shackled; a prisoner, and can do nothing!&#8217;</p>

		<p>He made a hasty step to the door, opened it, and beckoned to the officer
		to come in. As he did so, he shut it after him, took the man by the
		arm, and drew him to one end of the room:</p>

		<p>&#8216;I want a week,&#8217; said he, in a quick tone. &#8216;I&#8217;ll give a thousand dollars
		to gain one week; and at the end of that time will surrender myself
		a prisoner.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The man shook his head: &#8216;It can&#8217;t be done, Sir,&#8217; said he.</p>

		<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s the reward offered for my apprehension?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;A cool five hundred,&#8217; replied the officer.</p>

		<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll double it to escape,&#8217; said Rust, &#8216;or to gain a week, but a single
		week.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The man shook his head. &#8216;Too many knows that we&#8217;re arter you.
		It wouldn&#8217;t do.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;But at the expiration of that time I would surrender myself, and
		you could secure the reward too.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The man gave vent to a low chuckle; and placed his finger on the side
		of his nose, accompanying the motion with a sly expression, signifying
		an utter disbelief in Rust&#8217;s promises.</p>

		<p>Rust gnawed his lip with fierce impatience, then taking the man by
		the arm, he led him into the hall, and shut the door.</p>

		<p>&#8216;I must speak out,&#8217; said he, &#8216;and trust to your honor not to betray
		me. A villain has seduced my child. I want time to find him, and to
		compel him to make her his wife. Now you know why I ask a week.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The officer at first whistled, then muttered something about its being
		a hard case; but concluded by saying, in a positive tone: &#8216;It can&#8217;t be
		did, Sir; I&#8217;m sorry for it; upon my word, I am; but I must keep you
		now that I&#8217;ve got you. I wish you&#8217;d given me the slip at first; but I
		can&#8217;t let you go now. It&#8217;s impossible&#8212;quite.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Rust eyed the man, as if endeavoring to find in his hard features
		some loop-hole to his more kindly feelings; but apparently he met with
		no success.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Well, if it can&#8217;t be done, there&#8217;s an end of it,&#8217; said he, abruptly terminating
		his scrutiny. &#8216;I&#8217;ve some other matters to speak of, and want
		a few moments more. I&#8217;ll not detain you long, and will call you when
		I&#8217;m ready.&#8217;</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page479" title="479"><!-- original reads 489 --></a>&#8216;I&#8217;ll give you all the time I can,&#8217; said the man, civilly.</p>

		<p>Rust turned to enter the room, but as he did so he heard a quick step
		behind him; and looking round, found himself face to face with a young
		man of two or three and twenty, elegantly dressed, who eyed him carelessly,
		and then passing him, entered the room with the air of one perfectly
		at home. A suspicion of who he was flashed across Rust&#8217;s mind.
		That he himself was unknown to the other was not strange, for he had
		been so much absent, and when he visited his child it was at such irregular
		intervals, and for such short periods, that a person might have
		been even a frequent visitor at his house, without encountering him.
		Nor was there any thing in the outward appearance of the slovenly,
		haggard old man to attract attention. But the indifference of the other
		was not reciprocated; for Rust followed him, and closed the door after
		him, with feverish haste, as if he feared his prey might escape him.
		He observed the deep blush that sprang to the cheek of his daughter, at
		the entrance of the stranger; her guilty, yet joyous look as he addressed
		her; and above all, he perceived <em>his</em> careless, cold, indifferent reply to
		her warm salutation; and a feeling of revenge, the deadliest that he
		had ever felt, sprung up in his heart against that man; not so much
		because he had blasted the happiness of his child, as because he had
		torn from <em>him</em> all that he had clung to in life.</p>

		<p>Rust walked to the fire-place, turned his back to it, and without uttering
		a word, faced the stranger, who eyed him from head to foot with a
		cool, supercilious stare; then looked at the girl, as if seeking an explanation.</p>

		<p>The pause, however, was broken by Rust himself, as he pointed with
		his thin finger to their visitor, and inquired of his daughter: &#8216;Is <em>that</em>
		the man?&#8217;</p>

		<p>The girl&#8217;s face became ghastly pale; her lips moved, but she dared
		not raise her eyes; for she could not encounter the keen, inquiring look
		which she knew was fixed upon her.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Answer my question,&#8217; said he, sternly. &#8216;This is no time for tampering
		with my patience.&#8217;</p>

		<p>His daughter attempted to speak. She trembled from head to foot;
		but not a word escaped her. So intense was her anguish, that it awoke
		a spark of better feeling in the young man; for confronting Rust, he
		said in a bold voice: &#8216;If you have any questions to ask respecting me,
		address them to <em>me</em>, not to <em>her</em>.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;I will,&#8217; replied Rust, fixing upon him an eye that fairly glowed;
		&#8216;for you should best know your own character. Are you the cold-blooded
		scoundrel who, taking advantage of that girl&#8217;s confiding disposition,
		of the absence of her father, stole like a thief into his house; by
		lies, by false oaths, and damning hypocritical professions of love, won
		her affections; blighted her, and then left her what I blush to name?
		You wish the question addressed to you; you have it. I&#8217;ll have your
		reply.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Withering like a parched leaf; shrinking as if a serpent were in his
		path; with a face which changed from white to red, from red to white,
		the stranger met these questions. But Rust&#8217;s eye never left his face.
		There was no trace of anger nor emotion, in his marble features. He
		merely said: &#8216;I want your answer.&#8217;</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page480" title="480"><!-- original reads 490 --></a>With a face heavy with guilt; with a voice that shook even while it
		assumed a tone of boldness; the stranger demanded: &#8216;Who are you?
		and what right have you to question me thus?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Not <em>much</em> right,&#8217; replied Rust; &#8216;I&#8217;m not even a rival suitor; I&#8217;m
		<em>only</em> this girl&#8217;s father. Perhaps you will answer me now.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The other was silent. Rust turned to his daughter, and said: &#8216;This
		man has suddenly become dumb. Is this he of whom we spoke? An
		answer I must have, and a true one. Do not add a lie to the infamy
		which already covers you.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The girl hesitated, and then uttered something in a voice so low as
		to be scarcely audible; but faint as it was, Rust caught the words,
		&#8216;<em>It is!</em>&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;It is well,&#8217; replied he, facing the stranger, and drawing his person
		up erect. &#8216;I have no time to waste in words, and will state what I have
		to say as concisely as possible, and will act as promptly as I speak.
		This is my only child. She was once unsullied, and I was proud of her:
		that she is not so <em>now</em>, is your fault. There is but one mode of repairing
		what you&#8217;ve done. Will you marry her?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;I certainly intend to do so,&#8217; said the young man, with a guilty look,
		which gave the lie to his words.</p>

		<p>&#8216;I want <em>deeds</em>, not <em>intentions</em>,&#8217; replied Rust. &#8216;What you do must be
		done <em>now</em>&#8212;before you leave this room. A clergyman resides within a
		mile. In half an hour he can be here.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The girl clasped her hands joyfully, and looked eagerly at him; but
		there was nothing responsive in the expression of his face; and he
		answered:</p>

		<p>&#8216;I can&#8217;t see the necessity of this haste; beside, it would ruin all my
		prospects.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;<em>You</em> can&#8217;t see the necessity of this haste!&#8217; exclaimed Rust, in a voice
		of thunder. &#8216;Ruin <em>your</em> prospects! What has become of <em>her</em> prospects?
		<span class="keep_together">What&#8212;what&#8212;&#8212;</span> But no matter,&#8217; added he, choking down a
		fierce burst of passion, and suddenly assuming a tone so unnaturally
		calm that it might have been a warning to the other that it was but a
		lull in the storm. &#8216;Michael Rust presents his compliments to his unknown
		friend, and begs to know if he will do him the honor of marrying,
		on the spot, his daughter whom he has polluted?&#8217;</p>

		<p>He paused for an answer; his lips were deadly white, and quivering;
		and his eye glowed like a serpent&#8217;s. The young man quailed before it;
		but apparently he was only waiting for an opportunity to throw off the
		mask; for he answered boldly: &#8216;No, I will not.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;You had better,&#8217; said Rust, in a low, warning tone. &#8216;Think of it
		again.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;You have my answer,&#8217; was the reply.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Then take Michael Rust&#8217;s thanks!&#8217; A flash and report followed;
		and when the smoke cleared away, the seducer was lying on the floor,
		stone dead. A bullet had passed through his head. The policeman
		rushed in the room.</p>

		<p>&#8216;If I could have had a week, I might have avoided this,&#8217; said Rust,
		coldly. &#8216;As it was, I had no alternative.&#8217;</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page481" title="481"><!-- original reads 491 --></a>He rang the bell, and a servant came in. He pointed to his daughter,
		who was lying senseless at his feet.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Look to your mistress!&#8217;</p>

		<p>Turning to the police men who stood by with blanched faces, he said:
		&#8216;Now then, I am ready!&#8217;</p>

		<h4 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN.</h4>

		<p><span class="first_word">In</span> a small room, containing a box-bedstead, a single chair, and a common
		wooden table, on which was a pitcher of water, sat Michael Rust.
		The heavy iron bars which grated the windows, and the doors of thick
		oaken plank, secured by strong bolts of iron, indicated beyond a doubt
		the nature of his abode&#8212;a prison. He was sitting on the edge of his
		bed, with his arms resting on the table, which was drawn close to it,
		and his head leaning upon them. At times he straightened himself up,
		looked listlessly about the room, and then resumed his old position.</p>

		<p>A key turned in the door; the heavy bolt was drawn back, and a
		head was thrust in.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Some one wants to see you. Shall he come in?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The head was withdrawn, and the door being opened, admitted no less
		a person than Mr. Kornicker, somewhat faded in appearance since we
		last saw him, but still wearing an air of dashing pretension. He stood
		at the door, shaking his head, winking to himself, and fumbling in his
		pocket, evidently in a state of great mental perplexity, probably from
		his entertaining doubts as to what would be the character of his reception;
		or from his being equally uncertain as to the best mode of opening
		the conversation. Nor was he at all relieved by Rust, who without
		moving, fastened his eye upon him with a cold, steadfast stare.</p>

		<p>Kornicker, however, seemed to have fixed upon his course of action
		at last; for he walked up to him, and stretching out his hand, said:</p>

		<p>&#8216;Wont you give us your flipper, my old fellow? You&#8217;re in trouble,
		but I&#8217;ll stand by you to the last. If I don&#8217;t, damme!&#8217; He struck his
		other hand on the table, and nodded and winked with great vehemence.</p>

		<p>&#8216;So there is yet one who has not turned his back on the felon,&#8217; said
		Rust, partly addressing Kornicker and partly speaking to himself; &#8216;one
		true man; a rare thing in this world; a jewel&#8212;a jewel, beyond all
		price; and like all costly stones, found only in the poorest soils; but,&#8217;
		added he, &#8216;what have <em>I</em> done to gain friends, or to link one solitary heart
		to my fortunes?&#8212;what?&#8217;</p>

		<p>He shook his head; and although his face was unmoved, and he
		spoke in the low, half-soliloquizing manner of one who rather brooded
		over the past than regretted it, yet there was something so sad in his
		tone, and in his melancholy gesture, that it did more to call forth the
		warm feelings of Kornicker than the most eloquent language.</p>

		<p>&#8216;What have you done?&#8217; demanded he, earnestly; &#8216;I&#8217;ll <em>tell</em> you what
		you did. When I was at low water mark, with scarce a rag to my
		back or a crust to my stomach, and without a prospect of getting one,
		you took me by the hand, and in a <span class="keep_together">d&#8212;&#8212;d</span> gentlemanly way gave me a
		<a class="pagenum" id="page482" title="482"><!-- original reads 492 --></a>h&#8217;ist out of the gutter. <em>That&#8217;s</em> what you did; and if you <em>did</em> flare up
		now and then, and haul me over the coals; it was soon over, and soon
		forgotten. I don&#8217;t bear malice, old fellow; no, no. It isn&#8217;t my way;
		and as you&#8217;re in trouble now, if I <em>can</em> help you, I <em>will</em>. Never desert
		any one; am unfortunately bloody short of cash; but you can have
		what I&#8217;ve got, and when I get more, you shall have <em>that</em> too.&#8217;</p>

		<p>As he spoke, he plunged his hand to the bottom of his pocket, drew
		out a very shabby-looking pocket-book, deposited it on the table.</p>

		<p>&#8216;It isn&#8217;t much; but you&#8217;ll find it useful here, and you&#8217;re welcome
		to it. This isn&#8217;t the shop where nothing put out at interest produces a
		heavy income.&#8217;</p>

		<p>This offer had a powerful effect upon Rust; and it seemed as if some
		long dormant feelings were working their way to the surface from the
		depths of his heart. He gazed earnestly at his clerk, and once or twice
		opened his mouth to speak; but finally he got up, and taking the pocket-book
		from the table, handed it back to Kornicker, saying:</p>

		<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m not in want of money. Gold is but dross <em>now</em>. I&#8217;ve plenty of
		it; but its value in my eyes is gone.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;But,&#8217; remonstrated Kornicker, holding his hands behind him, and
		looking obstinately in another direction, partly to avoid taking the
		pocket-book and partly to resist the solicitations of his own necessities,
		which were strenuously urging him to do so, &#8216;but you may want a
		lawyer to fight for you at your trial.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;For that farce I am prepared. I <em>have</em> one. He&#8217;s paid for it, and
		he&#8217;ll fight,&#8217; said Rust. &#8216;It will avail nothing, for I did slay the man.
		It was a cold-blooded, deliberate murder. I planned it; I went up to
		that place with the stern determination to commit it; and I <em>did</em> commit
		it. It was no hasty act, done in a moment of fierce and sudden passion;
		but a deed duly and deliberately meditated, and one that I would repeat.
		What <em>he</em> had done, it&#8217;s useless to mention. I had no redress, except
		what my own hand could give me. He has paid his forfeit, and I&#8217;ll
		pay mine. I&#8217;ll fight to the last; because,&#8217; added he, with that expression
		of stern purpose which so often settled on his face, &#8216;Michael Rust
		never yields; and then, let the law do its worst. Take your money;
		I don&#8217;t need it.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Kornicker hesitated; and then thrusting it in his pocket, said: &#8216;I
		suppose, if you should happen to be short, you&#8217;ll let me know.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;I will,&#8217; replied Rust; &#8216;but I&#8217;ve enough to last until my sand is run
		out. They&#8217;ll hang me.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t talk so,&#8217; exclaimed Kornicker, with a feeling not a little akin
		to fear, at the cold, indifferent manner in which the other spoke. &#8216;You
		<em>may</em> escape&#8212;who knows?&#8217;</p>

		<p>Rust looked at him steadily, and then said, in a low, calm voice: &#8216;If
		it were not that man and law were leagued against me to <em>force</em> me to
		my doom, not one dollar would Michael Rust give to add an hour to his
		life. He looks to the grave only as that dark abyss which knows neither
		thought nor care; where the past is forgotten; where the future ends.
		Death is but a deep dreamless sleep, which has no waking. Yet even
		this boon he will not accept, if it&#8217;s <em>forced</em> upon him.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;But the disgrace, the disgrace of such an end,&#8217; exclaimed Mr. Kornicker,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page483" title="483"><!-- original reads 493 --></a>twisting his fingers together, and in his earnestness cracking the
		knuckles of all of them. &#8216;Think of that, my old fellow. Think of
		the stain that will always rest upon your memory.&#8217;</p>

		<p>A smile, without a trace of pleasure, but cold and icy, passed across
		Rust&#8217;s face.</p>

		<p>&#8216;What is my memory to me? What care I for the whispers and
		sneers and surmises of the reptiles who crowd this world, and who will
		soon be as <em>I</em> then shall be? What are these very men themselves?
		Shadows!&#8212;shadows! Go&#8212;my course is chosen. You can do nothing
		for me.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Still Kornicker did not show any intention of quitting the room, but
		shifted from one leg to the other, in a fidgety manner, as if he had something
		farther to communicate, upon which however he did not like to
		venture. At last he said: &#8216;Your daughter?&#8217;</p>

		<p>Rust turned a quick keen eye on him, but farther than this evinced
		no emotion.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Perhaps she may need a friend, when&#8212;when&#8212;&#8212;&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m dead,&#8217; said Rust, concluding what seemed to be rather an embarrassing
		sentence to Kornicker.</p>

		<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m not exactly the fellow to make the offer,&#8217; said Kornicker, adopting
		the conclusion which Rust had given to the phrase; &#8216;but&#8212;but I&#8217;ll
		keep an eye on her, and will lend her a helping hand if she gets in
		trouble.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Rust&#8217;s countenance expressed neither pleasure nor anger, as he answered:</p>

		<p>&#8216;Nothing can be done for her. Her fate is sealed; her path is marked
		out. There is neither turn nor winding in it, nor escape from the destiny
		to which it leads. She has taken the first step in it, and must follow
		it to the end. Look at the reckless and abandoned of her sex, who
		crowd our thoroughfares at night. <em>Their</em> fate must be <em>her</em> fate; an
		outcast&#8212;then the tenant of a public prison where her associates will
		be the thief and the felon. That&#8217;s her second step. The third is&#8212;to
		her coffin; broken down; beggared, perhaps starving, she&#8217;ll die surrounded
		by the offscouring of the earth&#8212;happy if she reaches her
		grave before she has run her full course.&#8217;</p>

		<p>There was something in the apathetic manner in which the old man
		pointed out the future fate of his own child, that actually silenced Kornicker.
		He knew not what to say. There was no grief to console;
		no anger to deprecate; no wish to be fulfilled. He had however come
		to the prison with his mind made up to do something, and he did not like
		to be thwarted in his purpose. But before he had fairly determined what
		course was to be pursued next, Rust interrupted the current of his ideas
		by saying, as he pressed his hand upon his heart:</p>

		<p>&#8216;You can do nothing for me. The disease is <em>here</em>; and the only
		physician who can heal it is Death. Could you blot the past from my
		memory and leave it one vast blank; could you gild the future with
		hopes which this heart did not tell me were utterly hollow; then perhaps
		Michael Rust might struggle on, like thousands of others, with
		some object in view, always to be striven for, but always receding
		as he advanced, or turning to ashes in his grasp. But it cannot be.
		<a class="pagenum" id="page484" title="484"><!-- original reads 494 --></a>I&#8217;ve played my part in the great drama of life, and the curtain will soon
		fall.&#8217;</p>

		<p>A spirit of callous indifference pervaded all that he said and did;
		and making a gesture to Kornicker, forbidding all farther remark, he
		threw himself on the bed, and drew the clothes about his head, as if
		determined to shut out all sound.</p>

		<p>Kornicker made one or two efforts to draw him again into conversation,
		but the communicative mood was past; and finding that nothing farther
		was to be done, he left him to his meditations.</p>

		<p>From that time Kornicker, true to his maxim of deserting no one,
		was constant in his visits and endeavors to comfort and assist him in
		preparing for his trial. But never had man a more arduous task than
		he found in this self-imposed duty; for the hidden transactions of Rust&#8217;s
		past life had become public, and had turned the full tide of popular
		feeling against him; and far and wide, through town and country, with
		all that could excite public animosity, rang that bloody tale, (for the dead
		man had powerful friends to battle for vengeance.) It was in every
		mouth, and whispered in every ear. In the broad glare of day, and
		before the eyes of the whole world, was paraded every secret of Rust&#8217;s
		life. Witnesses who had been forgotten and had sunk from sight, and
		were supposed to be dead, sprang into life, all having some dark deed to
		record. Pamphlets, teeming with exaggerated details of the murder,
		were hawked through the streets; peddled at every corner; hung in
		every shop window. Rust&#8217;s own black life had prejudged him, and
		had turned public opinion into public hate; until every voice called out
		for blood. It was under this feeling that his trial came on.</p>

		<p>Early on that morning, long before the court was opened, a stream of
		people was thronging toward the City Hall by twenties and thirties and
		hundreds. The iron gates were barred to keep them out; still they
		contrived to get in, and swarmed through the halls. And when the
		court was opened, officers armed with staves were stationed on the stairs,
		to fight them down, for there was no room for them. The court-room
		was crammed with men heaped upon men, climbing one on the other;
		heads upon heads, swarming like bees, and packed and wedged together,
		leaving not a foot to spare. And in the midst of all that living mass sat
		Rust, unmoved, unflinching; returning look for look, defiance for defiance;
		reckless as to his fate, but resolute not to yield.</p>

		<p>There was one however at that trial who was not so indifferent. He
		was a man of about fifty, tall and thin, with a grave, dignified face,
		which yet bore a strong resemblance to that of Rust. He was deadly
		pale, and sat next to Rust&#8217;s lawyers, conversing with them in a low
		earnest tone; and at times, as the trial went on, suggesting questions to
		them. This was Rust&#8217;s brother; the father of the two children, who,
		generous to the last, had forgiven all, and was battling for the life of
		him who had done his utmost to blast his. If Rust&#8217;s cold eye sank, or
		his spirit quailed, it was only when he encountered the mild, sad eye
		of that brother.</p>

		<p>The jury was empanelled. The District Attorney opened for the
		prosecution; and then the examination of witnesses commenced. Foot
		by foot and inch by inch was the ground contested by Rust&#8217;s counsel.
		<a class="pagenum" id="page485" title="485"><!-- original reads 495 --></a>Exceptions to testimony were taken, points of law raised, and every informality
		or technicality, which afforded a loop-hole for objection, was
		taken advantage of. The day dragged heavily on, and Rust grew weary.
		The constant stir about him; the hum of voices, occasionally hushed
		into silence at the cry of the officer, or the tap of the judge on his desk;
		the hot, stifling air of the room; the wranglings of the lawyers, all
		tended to bewilder him. All excitement had long since left him. A
		leaden heaviness had settled upon all his faculties, and leaning his head
		upon the table, even while life and death were in the scale, he slept
		soundly.</p>

		<p>He was aroused by his lawyer, touching his arm. He sat up, and
		gazed vacantly about him.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Who&#8217;s that?&#8217; said he, pointing to the witness&#8217;s stand.</p>

		<p>Rust half started to his feet; then clasping his hands hard together,
		sat down, and leaned his head on the table, but said not a word.</p>

		<p>The clerk called out her name.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Ellen Colton.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Who is she?&#8217; demanded the lawyer.</p>

		<p>Rust drew himself up; and many who had been watching him, observed
		that his face had become perfectly corpse-like; his breathing
		oppressed, and that his eyes seemed starting from their sockets, as he
		fixed them on the witness.</p>

		<p>&#8216;My own flesh and blood,&#8217; muttered he; &#8216;my own child!&#8217;</p>

		<p>The girl was sworn; but it was evident that a terrible struggle was
		going on, and she had to be supported to a chair. The lawyer for the
		prosecution took down her name, and then asked her a question. He
		received no answer. He repeated it; but the girl was silent. She
		held down her head, and seemed half fainting.</p>

		<p>&#8216;You <em>must</em> reply,&#8217; said the judge.</p>

		<p>The girl raised her eyes, and said, in a low supplicating tone, &#8216;He&#8217;s
		my father.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The judge shook his head. &#8216;It&#8217;s a very painful task,&#8217; said he, &#8216;but
		there&#8217;s no alternative.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The girl uttered not a word, and the court-room became so hushed
		that even the hard breathing of the witness was audible.</p>

		<p>&#8216;I must have a decided answer,&#8217; said the judge, gravely, yet mildly,
		for he respected the feelings which dictated her course. &#8216;Will you
		answer the question put by the district attorney?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;I will not,&#8217; was the firm reply.</p>

		<p>The face of the judge grew a little flushed, and he compressed his
		lips, as if the duty which now rested with him were an unpleasant one.
		But before he had time to speak, the district attorney rose, and muttering
		in a tone loud enough to be heard, &#8216;I will not slay the parent through
		the child,&#8217; said: &#8216;If the court please, I withdraw the question. I&#8217;ll
		call another witness.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The judge bowed, and the girl was led away.</p>

		<p>Rust had risen to his feet as if to speak, but he sat down, and the
		trial proceeded. The whole of that day passed in the examination of
		witnesses; so did the day following. Then came the summing up of
		the lawyers, and the charge of the judge to the jury. During the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page486" title="486"><!-- original reads 496 --></a>whole time the crowd came and went, but at all times the room was
		thronged. The jury went out; still the crowd hung about the Hall.
		It grew dark; but they could not go to their homes until they knew
		the result; but round and round the Hall, and through the avenues of
		the Park, they wandered, watching the dim light in the jury room, and
		wondering what the verdict would be. One of them stole up to the
		gray-headed constable who watched at the door, and inquired what the
		chance was; and as the old man shook his head, and muttered that
		they leaned toward a fatal verdict, he rubbed his hands with glee, and
		hastened to communicate the tidings to those below. Twelve&#8212;one&#8212;two&#8212;three
		o&#8217;clock at night came; still the twelve men held out, and
		still the judge, an upright, conscientious, patient man, maintained his
		post, waiting for the verdict, and ready to solve any doubts or points of
		law that might arise. The court-room grew cold; the fires went out,
		except one near the bench, and where the prisoner was. Sixty or
		seventy persons were sitting in the dim recesses of the room, looking
		like dark shadows, resolved to await the result. A few stretched themselves
		on the benches, and others gathered in knots near the fire, and
		whispered together; and now and then there was a loud laugh, suddenly
		hushed, as the person who uttered it remembered where he was.
		At last the judge went out, and left word with the officer to send for
		him if the jury agreed, or wanted his advice. The night waned; the
		sky grew gray in the east; and presently the day broke&#8212;but no verdict.
		At an early hour the judge returned, and the court-room filled
		again. Nine&#8212;ten&#8212;eleven. Suddenly there was a hum&#8212;a shuffling
		in the hall. The door was thrown open by the gray-headed constable,
		and the jury entered.</p>

		<p>&#8216;The jury&#8217;s agreed,&#8217; cried the officer. There was a dead silence;
		and the foreman gave in the verdict:</p>

		<p>&#8216;<span class="special_emphasis">Guilty of Murder in the first degree!</span>&#8217;</p>

		<p>Rust moved not; no change of color or feature was perceptible, except
		a slight smile, and that too faded in a moment.</p>

		<p>The trial was over; and the crowd poured through the streets, yelling
		with delight, and stopping those whom they met, to tell them that
		Michael Rust was doomed to die.</p>

		<p>Rust sat without stirring, until an officer touched him, and told him
		that he must go. He then rose, and followed him without a word.
		The crowd gathered around him, as he went out; but he did not notice
		them. His brother walked at his side, but he heeded him not; and
		when he reached his prison, without uttering a word, he flung himself
		wearily upon his bed, and was soon sound asleep.</p>

		<p>He awoke, a different man; and when his lawyer called to see him
		on the following day, he found him as fierce as a caged beast. He
		endeavored to utter some remark of consolation; but Rust impatiently
		motioned him to be silent. He spoke about a clergyman; but the
		reply was a laugh, so mocking and scornful, that he was glad to drop
		the theme.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Is the game ended?&#8217; at last inquired Rust. &#8216;Is there no farther
		cast of the die left?&#8217;</p>

		<p>The lawyer looked at him, as if in doubt of his meaning.</p>

		<p>Rust, in response to the look, repeated the question. &#8216;Is there nothing
		<a class="pagenum" id="page487" title="487"><!-- original reads 497 --></a>more to be done, in that farce called the law? Is there no farther blow
		to be struck for life?&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;We can appeal,&#8217; replied the lawyer; &#8216;but there is little chance of
		success.&#8217; He took Rust by the hand, and said in a soothing tone: &#8216;My
		poor friend, you must be prepared for the worst; for I cannot promise
		to save your life.&#8217;</p>

		<p>Rust rose and stood directly in front of him; and pointing to a small
		coin which lay on the table, said: &#8216;Not the tenth part of <em>that</em> would
		Michael Rust give to have one hour added to his life; but I <em>will not</em>
		be driven from it. I <em>will not</em> be beaten down and crushed.&#8217; He stamped
		furiously on the floor.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Fight!&#8217; said he, fixing his glaring eye on the lawyer; &#8216;fight to the
		last; leave nothing untried; spare not gold; bribe&#8212;corrupt&#8212;suborn;
		do any thing; but do not leave the triumph to my enemies. It&#8217;s that
		that is tearing away at my heart. It&#8217;s <em>that</em> which is killing me,&#8217;
		exclaimed he, bitterly, shaking his hands over his head.</p>

		<p>&#8216;We shall leave nothing untried,&#8217; said the lawyer. &#8216;Perhaps too
		we may obtain a pardon, for if ever a murder was justifiable, that was.&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;Pardon!&#8217; exclaimed Rust with a sneer; &#8216;<em>pardon</em>! Because I defended
		my own flesh and blood; because the laws had forced upon <em>me</em>
		the task which <em>they</em> should perform! I must die, or sue for pardon.
		A noble thing is law!&#8217;</p>

		<p>The lawyer was silent. He felt that Rust&#8217;s own previous criminal
		life had been his worst enemy, and that it was the disclosure of his
		own evil plans which had been in every mouth long before the trial,
		that had done much to harden the feelings of the jury, who in another
		case might have stretched a point to save him.</p>

		<p>Merely repeating what he had already said, that every thing should
		be tried, he took his leave.</p>

		<p class="prose_break">&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;</p>

		<p>Several weeks elapsed. The appeal was made, and was unsuccessful;
		the decision of the court below was affirmed; and nothing
		was left but that the sentence of the law should be enforced. Rust
		still maintained his indifferent bearing. All attempts to move him to
		any thing like repentance were unavailing. Pious men had conversed
		with him, but he had turned a deaf ear to their words; clergymen, too,
		anxious even at the last hour to turn his thoughts to holier things, had
		called upon him, but were equally unsuccessful; and at last he forbade
		them admission.</p>

		<p>It was just about dusk, on the day previous to that fixed for his execution,
		that he was sitting in his cell, when he was aroused by the
		opening of the door. He looked up, and observed a dim figure just
		inside the door, cowering as if with fear; but it was so dark that he
		could not distinguish more than its mere outline.</p>

		<p>&#8216;What do you want?&#8217; demanded he, harshly. &#8216;Am I a wild beast,
		that you have come to stare at me?&#8217;</p>

		<p>The only reply was a low, suppressed cry, as of one endeavoring to
		stifle down severe pain.</p>

		<p>Rust rose up, advanced to the figure, and with a sudden jerk threw
		off the cloak which enveloped it. It was his own child.</p>

		<p>&#8216;So it&#8217;s <em>you</em>!&#8217; said he, bitterly, as he turned from her. &#8216;And you&#8217;ve
		<a class="pagenum" id="page488" title="488"><!-- original reads 498 --></a>come to see your work. Look at me well. You&#8217;ve succeeded to your
		heart&#8217;s content.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The girl endeavored to clasp his hand, but he flung her from him;
		and facing her, said: &#8216;What you have to say, say at once, and be
		gone. There is little policy in seeking me out now, for I have nothing
		to give.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The girl cast herself at his feet, in a passion of grief. &#8216;Oh! father!
		dear father! I ask nothing, except your forgiveness. Give me <em>that</em>, for
		the love of <span class="special_name">God</span>! I ask nothing more. Do not refuse me that, as you
		hope for forgiveness of your own sins!&#8217;</p>

		<p>&#8216;There was a time,&#8217; said Rust, &#8216;when I could not have resisted
		those tones, when I could have refused you nothing. My very heart&#8217;s
		blood was yours; but I am changed&#8212;changed indeed; since not a
		single spark of tenderness for you is left; not even the shadow of the
		love which I once bore to you. You are a stranger to me; or worse
		than that, you are <em>she</em>, whose wanton conduct has placed me here, and
		to-morrow will lead me to the gallows.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The girl rose up hastily, and said in a quick husky voice:</p>

		<p>&#8216;Farewell, father; I will not stay until you curse me, for I fear it
		may come to that. May <span class="special_name">God</span> forgive both you and me! I have done
		wrong, and most bitterly have I suffered for it.&#8217;</p>

		<p>She caught his hand, pressed it to her lips, which were hot as fire,
		and left the cell.</p>

		<p>That was the last time that the father and daughter ever met.</p>

		<p>The gaoler soon afterward brought in a light, and asked Rust if
		he wanted any thing; and on being answered in the negative, went
		out.</p>

		<p>The night wore on heavily. Rust heard the clock, as its iron tongue
		struck the successive hours from his life. At last the hour of midnight
		sounded. He took out his watch, wound it up, and set it.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Your life will last longer than mine,&#8217; said he, as he held it to the
		light, and examined the face. He then placed it on the table, and
		leaning his head on his hand, contemplated it for a long time. Time
		was hurrying on; for while he was sitting thus, the clock struck&#8212;one.
		He looked about the room; went to the door, and listened; then resumed
		his seat, and thrusting his hand in his bosom, drew out a small
		vial, containing a dark liquid. He held it to the light; shook it;
		smiled; and applying it to his lips, swallowed its contents.</p>

		<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll disappoint the sight-seers,&#8217; said he. He raised the light; took
		a long and earnest survey of the room; undressed himself; sat on the
		edge of his bed, for a moment, apparently in deep thought; then got
		into bed and drew the cover closely about him.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Now, then,&#8217; said he, &#8216;the dream of life is past. I&#8217;ll soon know
		whether there is any waking from it.&#8217;</p>

		<p>These were his last words; for when the cell was opened in the
		morning, he was dead in his bed. As in life, so in death, his own evil
		acts clashed with his interests; for at an early hour in the morning a
		messenger arrived with a pardon. In consideration of the heinous
		nature of the provocation, which had led to the commission of Rust&#8217;s
		crime, and of the inadequate punishment inflicted by the laws for such
		offences, the governor had remitted his sentence.</p>

		<p class="work_reviewed"><span class="special_name">Curiosities of Literature, and the Literary Character Illustrated</span>. By I. C. <span class="special_name">D&#8217;Israeli</span>,
		Esq., D. C. L., F. S. A. With Curiosities of American Literature. By <span class="special_name">Rufus W. Griswold</span>.
		Complete in one volume. New-York: <span class="special_name">D. Appleton and Company</span>, Broadway.</p>

		<p><span class="first_word">The</span> ensuing remarks refer rather to the Supplement to <span class="special_name">D&#8217;Israeli&#8217;s</span> &#8216;Curiosities of Literature,&#8217;
		edited by Rev. <span class="special_name">Rufus W. Griswold</span>, than to the well-known work to which it adds
		its attractions. It is an excellent collection of the many odd and quaint and foolish and
		good things which our forefathers &#8216;did and performed.&#8217; Mr. <span class="special_name">Griswold</span> has spiced his
		work with a variety, though he has done it more judiciously than a splenetic author whom
		he introduces in his work, who, in a vexatious mood at some severe criticisms on a former
		book, puts a dozen or more rows of interrogation and exclamation-points, commas, semicolons,
		etc., and tells his readers &#8216;they may pepper and salt it as they please.&#8217; Mr. <span class="special_name">Griswold</span>
		well understands the history of American literature; and we venture to say there is
		no man in the country who knows the names and contents of so many American books as
		he. This knowledge he has found of great service to him, enabling him to lay his hand at
		once on those things most worthy of preservation. If he had understood the linking process a
		little better, it would perhaps have added to the interest of his work. A sort of running commentary
		would have given greater vivacity to the numerous extracts. The way isolated
		specimens of an author are introduced affects very much the impression they make. But
		Mr. <span class="special_name">Griswold</span> has succeeded well in gathering up the ravelled ends of our early literature;
		and the present edition of <span class="special_name">D&#8217;Israeli&#8217;s</span> Curiosities of Literature will be the only one for the
		future in the American market. The most &#8216;curious&#8217; part of our literary history is embraced
		in the revolution, with the short period preceding and following it. The British and
		Tories furnished endless themes to the pasquinader and ballad-maker, while the grave
		rights involved in the struggle called forth the efforts of more serious and thoughtful pens.
		The Puritans of New-England wrote most; and there is a union of the soundest sense
		with the most childish folly, the strongest character with the weakest prejudices in our
		good Yankee forefathers, that is quite incomprehensible. Like the Puritans of England in
		the time of <span class="special_name">Cromwell</span>, when called into the hall of debate to discuss the rights of man, or
		into the field to battle for them, he were a bold man who dare smile at them. Yet in their
		religious acts they were often bigoted, intolerant and puerile. The same incongruity is
		seen in their tastes. Men of deep poetical sentiment, they often murdered poetry for
		conscience sake. A man who could write a defence of the colonies with a pen that fairly
		glowed with the burning Saxon that fell from it, would not be shocked at all at the impropriety
		of the following epitaph on a tomb-stone:</p>

		<div class="poem">
		    <div class="stanza">
		        <p>&#8216;Here lies Jonathan Auricular,</p>
		        <p>Who walked in the ways of God perpendicular.&#8217;</p>
		    </div>
		</div>

		<p>Mr. <span class="special_name">Griswold</span> gives us a specimen of the versification of the 137th psalm, in the Bible;
		<a class="pagenum" id="page491" title="491"></a>one of the sweetest lyrics ever written, beginning &#8216;By the rivers of Babylon there we sat
		down; yea, we wept when we remembered Zion; we hanged our harps upon the willows,&#8217;
		etc. This psalm, whose exquisite beauties are so well preserved in our common English
		version, was put into verse with the rest of the psalms, by our pious forefathers. To their
		credit we can say, however, that the authors of the first version declare that they &#8216;have
		attended to conscience rather than to elegance&#8217; in completing their work. We cannot
		excuse President <span class="special_name">Dunster</span> of Harvard College, so easily, who revised the edition and sent
		it forth with the advertisement that they had in it a &#8216;special eye both to the gravity of the
		phrase of sacred writ, and to the sweetness of the verse;&#8217; especially when we find this
		same sweet psalm completely murdered by him. After stumbling along through two stanzas,
		he thus paraphrases. &#8216;They that led us into captivity,&#8217; he says:</p>

		<div class="poem">
		    <div class="stanza">
		        <p><span class="first_word">Required</span> of us a song, and thus</p>
		        <p class="i2">Askt mirth us waste who laid,</p>
		        <p>Sing us among, a Zion&#8217;s song,</p>
		        <p class="i2">Unto us then they said.</p>
		    </div>

		    <div class="stanza">
		        <p>The <span class="special_name">Lord&#8217;s</span> song sing can we, being</p>
		        <p class="i2">In stranger&#8217;s land?&#8212;then let</p>
		        <p>Lose her skill my right hand if I</p>
		        <p class="i2">Jerusalem forget.</p>
		    </div>

		    <div class="stanza">
		        <p>Let cleave my tongue my palate on</p>
		        <p class="i2">If mind thee doe not I,</p>
		        <p>If chief joys o&#8217;er I prize not more,</p>
		        <p class="i2">Jerusalem my joy,&#8217; etc., etc.</p>
		    </div>
		</div>

		<p>Such wretched stuff as this our good forefathers sung with the profoundest gravity; and
		those who thus murdered the king&#8217;s English and the Hebrew&#8217;s poem were called &#8216;poets!&#8217;
		Yet this same age could produce such poets as Mrs. <span class="special_name">Ann Bradstreet</span>, of whom her
		great panegyrist, <span class="special_name">John Norton</span>, in a poetical description of her says:</p>

		<div class="poem">
		    <div class="stanza">
		        <p>&#8216;Her heart was a brave palace, <em>broad street</em>,</p>
		        <p>Where all heroic simple thoughts did meet,</p>
		        <p>Where nature such a tenement had ta&#8217;en,</p>
		        <p>That other souls to hers dwelt in a lane.&#8217;</p>
		    </div>
		</div>

		<p>The <em>pun</em> here is good, but the comparison might have been dropped sooner without damage.
		The poem of Mrs. <span class="special_name">Bradstreet</span>, entitled &#8216;Contemplations,&#8217; possesses a great deal of
		merit, and proves her to be worthy of the extravagant praise of her extravagant admirer.
		The extracts from the poetry of Governor <span class="special_name">Wolcott</span> are very favorable to the poetic reputation
		of the governor. But the richest thing in the whole collection is the &#8216;Simple Cobbler
		of Aggawam,&#8217; occupying ten columns. The king-fashionable ladies, and long-haired
		young gentlemen, are successively put on the cobbler&#8217;s lapstone and hammered most industriously.
		And we must say, cobbler as he is, he appears to us to give vastly more <em>blows</em> than
		he takes stitches. This part of the work alone is worth the price of the whole book. It
		is quite too long to quote entire, and a mere extract would do it injustice. <span class="special_name">Freneau</span> was
		a rare character, and his pasquinades on <span class="special_name">Rivington</span>, a tory editor, are rich specimens.
		The confession he puts in the mouth of <span class="special_name">Rivington</span>, in his &#8216;Address to the Whigs of New-York&#8217;
		immediately after the close of the war, is equal to &#8216;Death and Dr. Hornbook&#8217; on the
		poor Scotch quack.</p>

		<p>This <span class="special_name">Rivington</span>, however, was not a more unlucky dog than another tory named <span class="special_name">Benjamin
		Towne</span>, editor of the &#8216;Pennsylvania Evening Post.&#8217; Supposing the cause of the rebels
		to be hopeless, he undertook to win favor and reward from the British by the most unsparing
		abuse of the Americans. But when the cause of freedom finally triumphed, the
		unlucky editor was left on the sand. Without money, without patrons, he found himself
		in the midst of those whom he had traduced, and dependent on them for a livelihood. In this
		emergency, he goes to the celebrated Dr. <span class="special_name">Witherspoon</span> for aid. The stern republican doctor
		would listen to nothing, unless <span class="special_name">Towne</span> would make his peace with his country by a
		most humble confession. Finding no other resource, he consented to publish in his paper
		any thing the doctor would write. This confession is given by Mr. <span class="special_name">Griswold</span> at length;
		<a class="pagenum" id="page492" title="492"></a>and if the tory editor does not make himself out a most precious scoundrel, the fault is certainly
		not with the doctor. He acknowledges that he had lied without limit, and was willing
		to publish bigger lies had they been brought him; he assures the people that he did every
		thing for personal gain, and was willing to do and say any thing now for the same purpose.
		He was moreover a brave man! &#8216;I hope,&#8217; says he, &#8216;the public will consider that I have
		been a timorous man, or if you will, a coward from my youth, so that I cannot fight; my
		belly is so large that I cannot run; and I am so great a lover of eating and drinking that
		I cannot starve. When these things are considered, I hope they will fully account for my
		past conduct, and procure me the liberty of going on in the same <em>uniform</em>, tenor for the future.&#8217;
		The collection teems with rich matter, and we have not even skimmed the surface.
		Here and there only have we touched a point. We could fill twice the space allotted
		us, with the revolutionary ballads alone, for the gathering of which Mr. <span class="special_name">Griswold</span> deserves
		our thanks. New-England epitaphs come in for their share; and there is a capital anecdote
		of Dr. <span class="special_name">Dwight</span> and Mr. <span class="special_name">Dennie</span>, at which we gazed and pondered wistfully for a
		long time, in the hope, (a vain one, we are sorry to say,) of being able to present it to our
		readers.</p>

		<p>This collection of Mr. <span class="special_name">Griswold</span> brings together and preserves what was before floating
		around and slowly disappearing with the lapse of time. Our early literature is now
		grafted on a work which will secure its life; and those peculiar characteristics of a remarkable
		age, which grow more valuable the more distant the point from which we view them,
		will never pass away. Nothing is more difficult than to preserve the scanty and fugitive
		literature of an early age. A <em>great</em> work will live; but those fragments which are thrown
		off here and there, in a careless or earnest moment, perish, because they <em>are</em> fragmentary.
		They do not belong together in a book, and cannot stand alone. In a later
		period of the history of the country, this would be of little consequence, because there is
		enough else to stand as exponents of that age. But these fragments are all that is left to
		tell us how our fathers felt, and thought, and spoke. Without them, we are without every
		thing. This collection greatly enhances the value of the English edition, and cannot fail
		to increase its already extensive sale.</p>

		<p class="work_reviewed"><span class="special_name">North-American Review for the April Quarter</span>. Number CXXIII. pp. 268. Boston:
		<span class="special_name">Otis, Broaders and Company</span>. New-York: C. S. <span class="special_name">Francis and Company</span>.</p>

		<p><span class="first_word">There</span> has not been issued for many a long month so good a number of this excellent
		and venerable Quarterly, as the one before us. It abounds in a good variety, alike of
		theme and style; and there is a manly, vigorous tone, and an independence of thought
		and expression, which we have not before observed, at least in so marked a degree. The
		number opens with a caustic and well-deserved critique upon the writings of <span class="special_name">James</span>, the
		novelist; and we are the more gratified at this, because the defects of this romancer are
		the besetting sins of certain of our own novelists, who had at one time a fair degree of
		transient popularity. A lack of skill in the creation or accurate delineation of individual
		character, which, instead of representing men and women, are didactic exhibitions of the
		author himself, projected into various personages, and all bearing an unmistakable family
		resemblance&#8212;this it is that is at the bottom of the sudden decadence into which the
		writings of one or two of our more prolific romancers have fallen, past all redemption; and
		this is the great fault of Mr. <span class="special_name">James</span>. &#8216;To be successful in the exact delineation of character,&#8217;
		says the reviewer, &#8216;requires a rare combination of powers&#8212;a large heart and a comprehensive
		mind. It is the attribute of universality; it can be obtained only by outward
		as well as inward observation; not by that habit of intense brooding over individual consciousness,
		of making the individual mind the centre and the circumference of every
		thing, a habit which only makes of the writer an egotist, and limits the reach of his mind.&#8217;
		<a class="pagenum" id="page493" title="493"></a>Mr. <span class="special_name">James</span> has certain types of character which he generally reproduces in each successive
		novel. His heroine is idealized into something which is neither spirit, nor flesh and
		blood. &#8216;His women, like his men, are ideas and feelings embodied; they are constructed,
		not created nor painted; built, not drawn. They do not stand boldly from the canvass.&#8217;
		His rascal is an unmitigated rascal, intermingled with the machinery of his plot, and
		appearing regularly in every novel. &#8216;Mr. <span class="special_name">James</span> is a great spendthrift of human life.
		The carelessness with which he slays, evinces the feebleness with which he conceives.
		If his personages were real to his own heart or imagination, he would not part with them
		so easily, nor kill them with such <em>nonchalance</em>.&#8217; A very faithful description is given of
		Mr. <span class="special_name">James&#8217;s</span> style; and it is one which will apply with equal force, though certainly in a
		subordinate case, to certain of our own novelists, whom the reader will readily recall, but
		whom it would be invidious perhaps to mention. &#8216;His style,&#8217; says the reviewer, &#8216;has
		little flow and perspicuity, and no variety. It is usually heavy, lumbering, and monotonous.
		Half of the words seem in the way of the idea, and the latter appears not to have
		strength enough to clear the passage. Occasionally, a short, sharp sentence comes like a
		flash of lightning from the cloud of his verbiage, and relieves the twilight of his diction.
		There are but few felicitous phrases in his manifold volumes. He has hardly any of those
		happy combinations of words which stick fast to the memory, and do more than pages to
		express the author&#8217;s meaning. He has little command of <em>expression</em>. His imagery is common;
		and his manner of arranging a trite figure in a rich suit of verbiage, only makes its
		essential commonness and poverty more apparent. His style is not dotted over with any
		of those shining points, either of imagery or epigram, which illumine works of less popularity
		and pretension.&#8217;</p>

		<p>The review of Mr. <span class="special_name">James&#8217;s</span> works is followed by an excellent critique upon the poems
		of Mr. <span class="special_name">James Russell Lowell</span>, which receive due commendation. There are some
		&#8216;rough truths&#8217; in the reviewer&#8217;s opening remarks. &#8216;We have among us little companies
		of people, each of which &#8216;keeps its poet,&#8217; and not content with that, proclaims from its
		small corner, with a most conceited air, that its poet is the man of the age.&#8217; Instances
		are mentioned, closing with this irresistible climax: &#8216;<em>One man</em> thinks <span class="special_name">Cornelius Mathews</span>
		has written the finest American poetry!&#8217; In allusion to the whimsical peculiarities of Mr.
		<span class="special_name">Carlyle</span>&#8212;a man of genius, learning, and humane tendencies&#8212;and their effect upon
		the servile tribe of imitators, the reviewer observes: &#8216;The study of German became an
		epidemic about the time that <span class="special_name">Carlyle</span> broke out; the two disorders aggravated each
		other, and ran through all the stages incident to literary affectation, until they assumed
		their worst form, and common sense breathed its last, as the &#8216;<em>Orphic Sayings</em>&#8217; came;
		those most unmeaning and witless effusions&#8212;we cannot say of the brain, for the smallest
		modicum of brains would have rendered their appearance an impossibility&#8212;but of mere
		intellectual inanity.&#8217; The American Euphuists, being possessed of the demon of affectation,
		strive to set themselves apart from the common herd, imagine that they are inhabitants
		of a sublimated ether, and look down with pitying contempt on all who profess
		an inability to detect a meaning in their vapid and mystical jargon. &#8216;These be <em>truths</em>;&#8217;
		and our readers will bear us witness that months ago, with but little variation of terms,
		we promulgated them in these pages.</p>

		<p>There is an excellent paper upon the &#8216;Forest Lands and the Timber Trade of Maine;&#8217;
		it is full of interest, despite the nature of its general theme. The &#8216;Boundary Question&#8217;
		did not indicate the first usurpations of the British in Maine. It was the acts of parliament
		that forbade the use of water-falls, the erecting of machinery, of looms and spindles,
		and the working of wood and iron; that set the king&#8217;s arrow upon trees that rotted in the
		forest; that shut out markets for boards and fish, and seized sugar and molasses, and the
		vessels in which these articles were carried; and that defined the limitless ocean as but a
		narrow pathway to such of the lands that it embosoms as wore the British flag; it was
		these restrictions, to release which the revolution was created. The articles upon the
		various &#8216;Theories of Storms,&#8217; and &#8216;The Recent Contest in Rhode-Island,&#8217; we have not
		<a class="pagenum" id="page494" title="494"></a>found leisure from pressing avocations to peruse. The paper on &#8216;Architecture in the
		United States&#8217; is from the pen of one who &#8216;<em>knows</em> whereof he writes;&#8217; and he has not
		been sparing of deserved satire upon the sad and ridiculous mistakes of those among us
		who are miscalled architects. High praise is awarded to our Trinity Church, now in
		progress of erection. &#8216;In size, in the delicacy and propriety of its decoration, and in the
		beauty of its general effect, it surpasses any church erected in England since the revival
		of the pointed style.&#8217; In a notice of the &#8216;Writings of Miss <span class="special_name">Bremer</span>,&#8217; <span class="special_name">Mary Howitt</span>
		&#8216;suffers some,&#8217; on account of a certain hysteric preface of hers to a translation of one of
		the Swedish lady&#8217;s productions, in which she complains of the American translations from
		this popular writer. Among the &#8216;Critical Notices&#8217; which compose the last article in the
		Review, is a critique upon Mr. <span class="special_name">Cornelius Mathews&#8217;s</span> &#8216;Writings,&#8217; including his poem on
		&#8216;Man in his Various Aspects,&#8217; which embodies the opinions we have ourselves expressed
		in relation to them. Since the unfounded charge of being &#8216;actuated by private pique,&#8217;
		which was brought against us by the author, cannot be assumed against the North American
		Review, we trust that our &#8216;complainant&#8217; will not object that we fortify our own estimate
		of his literary merits by grave authority. The following is an extract:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Mr. <span class="special_name">Mathews</span> has shown a marvellous skill in failing, each failure being more complete than the
			last. His comedy of &#8216;The Politicians&#8217; is &#8216;the most lamentable comedy;&#8217; and the reader exclaims,
			with Hippolyta, &#8216;This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.&#8217; The &#8216;Career of Puffer Hopkins&#8217; is an
			elaborately bad imitation of <span class="special_name">Dickens</span>; and must be ranked in fiction where &#8216;The Politicians&#8217; stands
			in the drama. It aims at being comical, and satirical upon the times. The author studies hard to
			portray the motley characters which move before the observer in a large city; but he has not enough
			of the vision and the faculty divine, to make them more than melancholy ghosts of what they profess
			to be. The attempts at humor are inexpressibly dismal; the burlesque overpowers the most determined
			reader, by its leaden dulness. The style is ingeniously tasteless and feeble. He who has read
			it through can do or dare any thing. Mr. <span class="special_name">Mathews</span> suffers from several erroneous opinions. He
			seems to think that literary elegance consists in the very qualities which make elegance impossible.
			Simplicity and directness of language he abominates. When he has an idea to express, he aims, apparently,
			to convert it into a riddle, by inventing the most forced, unnatural, and distorted expressions.
			If the thing can be obscured, he is sure to obscure it. He seems to say to the reader, &#8216;Can
			you guess? do you give it up?&#8217; But then, less obliging than the maker of charades, he leaves the
			puzzled victim without an explanation at last. He studies a singularity of phrase at once crabbed
			and finical, and overloads his pages with far-fetched epithets, that are at once harsh and unmeaning.
			He seems to have been told that he has wit and humor, and&#8212;strange delusion!&#8212;to believe it. He
			writes as if he imagined that he possessed the inventive power: never was a greater mistake. These
			qualities and these mistakes make his prose writings unreadable and intolerable, at least all the later
			ones. But when to the charms of his ordinary style are added the attractions of verse, then the sense
			aches with the combined and heightened beauties. The present volume exaggerates all his literary
			vices. The plan of these poems is very well; if executed with taste and power, the volume would
			have been interesting. As it is, we have here and there a good line, a striking figure, or a bold expression.
			But most of the poems are deformed by harshness of versification, feebleness of thought,
			and every species of bad writing. Compounded words, never seen before, and impossible to be pronounced,
			epithets detailed on service for which they are wholly unfit, figures that illustrate nothing
			but their own absurdity, and rhymes that any common book would die of, astonish the reader on
			every page. Had the poet purposely aimed to twist the English language into every conceivable
			form of awkwardness; had he designed to illustrate, for the use of beginners, every possible defect
			and every positive fault of diction; his success in accomplishing the object could not have been more
			complete.&#8217;</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>We annex a few of the &#8216;original&#8217; beauties which the reviewer has selected from Mr.
		<span class="special_name">Mathews&#8217;s</span> poem. Two or three of them, we perceive, are identical with those which
		we ourselves selected from that luminous effort of the mind and the imagination:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">We</span> had marked many characteristic passages in the present volume, to illustrate the observations
			we have felt called on to make. But we have space only for a few lines. In the first poem, besides
			many other absurdities of thought as well as expression, occurs this line:</p>

			<div class="poem">
			    <div class="stanza">
			        <p>&#8216;Strides he the globe, or <span class="small_all_caps">CANVASS-TENTS</span> the sea.&#8217;</p>
			    </div>
			</div>

			<p>Who ever heard of the verb to <em>canvass-tent</em>? To <em>canvass-back</em> the sea would be much more rational.</p>

			<p>In the second poem we find this luminous line:</p>

			<div class="poem">
			    <div class="stanza">
			        <p>&#8216;<span class="special_emphasis">Clear as the clear</span>, round midnight at its full,&#8217;</p>
			    </div>
			</div>

			<p>which must be very clear indeed.</p>

			<p>What can be the meaning of the following words in the &#8216;Teacher?&#8217;</p>

			<div class="poem">
			    <div class="stanza">
			        <p>&#8216;Whose eyes cry light through all its dawning void.&#8217;</p>
			    </div>
			</div>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page495" title="495"></a>Again, in the &#8216;Farmer:&#8217;</p>

			<div class="poem">
				<div class="stanza">
					<p>&#8216;Fierce revolutions rush in <span class="small_all_caps">WILD-ORBED</span> haste.&#8217;</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>In the &#8216;Mechanic,&#8217; the following very intelligible direction is given to the architect:</p>

			<div class="poem">
			    <div class="stanza">
			        <p>&#8216;In the first Builder&#8217;s gracious spirit work,</p>
			        <p>Through, hall, through enginery, and <span class="small_all_caps">TEMPLES MEEK</span>,</p>
			        <p><span class="special_emphasis">In grandeur towered, or lapsing beauty-sleek</span>,</p>
			        <p>Let order and creative fitness shine.&#8217;</p>
			    </div>
			</div>

			<p>In the &#8216;Merchant,&#8217; the poet affirms:</p>

			<div class="poem">
			    <div class="stanza">
			        <p>&#8216;Undimmed the man should through the trader shine.</p>
			        <p>And show the soul <span class="small_all_caps">UNBABIED</span> by his craft.&#8217;</p>
			    </div>
			</div>

			<p>This can only mean, that the soul of the trader ought not to be supplied with babies by his craft.</p>

			<p>The &#8216;Sculptor&#8217; ends with this prediction:</p>

			<div class="poem">
			    <div class="stanza">
			        <p>&#8216;And up shall spring through all the <span class="small_all_caps">BROAD-SET</span> land,</p>
			        <p>The <span class="small_all_caps">FAIR WHITE PEOPLE</span> of thy love unnumbered.&#8217;</p>
			    </div>
			</div>

			<p>In the &#8216;Journalist,&#8217; we find the following <em>directions to the printer</em>:</p>

			<div class="poem">
			    <div class="stanza">
			        <p>&#8216;Hell not the quiet of a Chosen Land,</p>
			        <p>Thou grimy man over thine engine bending.&#8217;</p>
			    </div>
			</div>

			<p><em>Hell</em>, as a common noun, is a sufficiently uncomfortable idea; but when converted into an active
	        verb, it becomes positively alarming.</p>

			<p>The poet thus advises &#8216;The Masses:&#8217;</p>

			<div class="poem">
			    <div class="stanza">
			        <p>&#8216;In vast assemblies calm, let order rule,</p>
			        <p class="i2">And every shout a cadence owning,</p>
			        <p class="i2">Make musical the vexed winds moaning,</p>
			        <p><span class="special_emphasis">And be as little children at a singing-school</span>.&#8217;</p>
			    </div>
			</div>

			<p>And the &#8216;Reformer&#8217; is told to</p>

			<div class="poem">
			    <div class="stanza">
			        <p>&#8216;Seize by its horns the shaggy Past,</p>
			        <p>Full of uncleanness.&#8217;</p>
			    </div>

		<p class="work_reviewed"><span class="special_name">A Practical Treatise on Midwifery</span>. By M. <span class="special_name">Chailly</span>, M. D., Professor of Midwifery, etc., etc.
		With two hundred and sixteen wood-cuts. Translated from the French, and edited by Dr. <span class="special_name">Gunning
		S. Bedford</span>, of the University of New-York. In one volume. pp. 530. <span class="special_name">Harper And
		Brothers</span>.</p>

		<p><span class="first_word">This</span> work comes to us under the fairest auspices. The author, M. <span class="special_name">Chailly</span>, is a distinguished
		Parisian lecturer on Obstetrics, a pupil of the eminent <span class="special_name">Paul Dubois</span>, of the
		University of Paris, and generally recognized as the exponent of the views of that celebrated
		<em>accoucheur</em>. By all who are familiar (and who of the medical world is not?) with
		the high reputation of <span class="special_name">Dubois</span> for sound medical philosophy and unbounded practical knowledge,
		it has been long regretted that the just opinions he so eloquently promulgates in the
		lecture-room have never assumed the diffusible shape of a printed book. M. <span class="special_name">Chailly</span>, in
		the work before us, supplies us with that which has been so much desired, and which Prof.
		<span class="special_name">Dubois</span> himself, from some cause not easily appreciated, has so long withheld from the
		world. The Parisian board of public instruction has moreover stamped the work of M.
		<span class="special_name">Chailly</span> with their approbation, and fixed it as the standard text-book of the French medical
		schools. This is a promise of excellence which a diligent perusal of the work will
		fully confirm. Professor <span class="special_name">Bedford</span>, the American translator, who has performed his duty
		as might be expected from his high character and prominent position, as Professor of the
		flourishing medical school of the University of New-York, felt the want of a good text-book
		for the student, and a sound practical guide for the physician, and has exhibited a
		sound judgment in this selection to supply that want. The work of <span class="special_name">Velpeau</span>, hitherto
		unquestionably the most popular book with the medical profession, is diffuse and speculative.
		The present work is direct, concise, and complete. Dr. <span class="special_name">Bedford</span> has enriched the
		original with copious notes, the result of his own extensive experience and observation.
		The publishers have performed their duty well, in presenting the work in a handsome
		library form; and it is only the very extensive business facilities of the <span class="special_name">Messrs. Harpers</span>
		that could afford so full and well illustrated a <em>scientific</em> book at so reasonable a price.</p>

		<p><span class="first_word">It</span> does not become us, perhaps, to enlarge upon the merits of this work, the character
		of which is known to many of our readers. As there are <em>other</em> many of them, however,
		who may not be conversant with much of the prose which makes up a large portion of its
		contents&#8212;having become subscribers to this Magazine since the &#8216;Ollapodiana&#8217; papers and
		the other prose miscellanies appeared in its pages&#8212;we shall venture to present a few extracts,
		and to preface them with the following remarks of the able Editor of the <em>United
		States Gazette</em>, of Philadelphia, upon the writer&#8217;s merits; praise, we may add, which has
		been confirmed by the kindred commendation of almost every journal in the Union:
		&#8216;Messrs. <span class="special_name">Burgess, Stringer and Company</span>, of New-York, have commenced the publication,
		in a series of numbers, of the Literary Remains of <span class="special_name">Willis Gaylord Clark</span>. The
		first number has been for some days upon our table, and after a biographical notice of the
		author, contains a portion of the &#8216;<em>Ollapodiana</em>,&#8217; those admirable papers furnished for the
		<span class="special_name">Knickerbocker</span>. Almost every body, who read five years ago, knows the <em>beauties</em> of
		<span class="special_name">Clark&#8217;s</span> composition. They are permanent beauties; beauties that always are to be
		found by those who ever had taste to admire them. They are not dependant upon a jingle
		of words for temporary popularity; they appeal from the heart to the heart, in language
		that knows no variation of time. They express sentiments that are permanent, feelings
		common to mankind; and those who would profit by a delicate delineation of the affections
		of the human heart, will love the poetry of <span class="special_name">Clark</span>. Those who would have a broader
		seal set upon manners, and the peculiarities of the mind set forth in pleasant grotesqueness,
		will smile at the &#8216;Ollapodiana.&#8217; But all will profit by <em>all</em>; and we regard it as a literary
		obligation conferred upon the age, and carrying with it a moral obligation also, to multiply
		the copies of such writings as <span class="special_name">Clark</span> prepared. We express not our feelings, when we
		write of <span class="special_name">Clark</span> as an author. There are some of us who knew his heart better than he
		did, and who have never forgotten his worth. These monuments, that are erected to his
		fame from his own works, like the trophies of victory, moulded to a triumphal pillar, denote
		public respect. Individual feeling loves a silent flow, that is constant and hearty.&#8217;</p>

		<p>If the reader has had the fortune to travel in a canal-packet, in the summer solstice, he
		will readily recognize the faithfulness of the following picture:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">At</span> first, when you embark, all seems fair; the eleemosynary negro, who vexes his clarionet, and
			governs its tuneful ventiges, to pay for his passage, seems a very Apollo to your ear; the appointments
			of the boat appear ample; a populous town slowly glides from your view, and you feel quite
			comfortable and contented. As yet, you have not gone below. &#8216;Things above&#8217; attract your attention&#8212;some
			pretty point of landscape, or distant steeple, shining among the summer trees. Anon,
			the scenery becomes tame, and you descend. A feeling comes over you as you draw your first breath
			in the cabin, which impels to the holding of your nose. The cabin is full; you have hit your head
			twice against the ceiling thereof, and stumbled sundry times against the seats at the side. Babies,
			vociferous babies, are playing with their mothers&#8217; noses, or squalling in appalling concert. If you
			stir, your foot treads heavily upon the bulbous toes of some recumbent passenger; if you essay to
			sleep, the gabble of those around you, or the noisy gurgle of a lock, arouses you to consciousness;
			and then, if you are of that large class of persons in whom the old Adam is not entirely crucified, then
			you <em>swear</em>. Have you any desire for literary entertainment? Approach the table. There shall you
			find sundry tracts; a copy of the Temperance Recorder; Goldsmith&#8217;s Animated Nature, and Plutarch&#8217;s
			Lives. By and by dinner approaches: and oh! how <em>awful</em> the suspense between the hours of preparation
			and realization! Slowly, and one by one, the dishes appear. At long intervals, or spaces of
			separation from each other&#8212;say five for the whole length of the boat&#8212;you behold tumblers arranged,
			with two forlorn radishes in each. The butter lies like gravy in the plate; the malodorous
			passengers of the masculine gender draw nigh to the scanty board; the captain comes near, to act
			<em>his</em> oft-repeated part, as President of the day. Oh, gracious! &#8217;tis a scene of enormous cry and scanty
			wool. It mendicants description. <span class="omitted_text">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> But the grand charm and scene of a canal packet is in the
			evening. You go below, and there you behold a hot and motley assemblage. A kind of stillness begins
			to reign around. It seems as if a protracted meeting were about to commence. Clergymen,
			capitalists, long-sided merchants, who have come from far, green-horns, taking their first experience
			of the wonders of the deep on the <em>canawl</em>, all these are huddled together in wild and inexplicable
			confusion. By and by the captain takes his seat, and the roll of berths is called. Then, what confusion!
			<a class="pagenum" id="page497" title="497"></a>Layer upon layer of humanity is suddenly shelved for the night; and in the preparation, what
			a world of bustle is required! Boots are released from a hundred feet, and their owners deposit them
			wherever they can. There was one man, <span class="special_name">Ollapod</span> beheld him, who pulled off the boots of another
			person, thinking the while&#8212;mistaken individual!&#8212;that he was disrobing his own shrunken legs of
			their leathern integuments, so thick were the limbs and feet that steamed and moved round about.
			Another tourist, fat, oily and round who had bribed the steward for two chairs placed by the side of
			his berth, whereon to rest his abdomen, amused the assembly by calling out; &#8216;Here, waiter! bring
			me another pillow! I have got the ear-ache, and have put the first one into my ear!&#8217; Thus wore
			the hours away. Sleep, you cannot. Feeble moschetoes, residents in the boat, whose health suffers
			from the noisome airs they are nightly compelled to breathe, do their worst to annoy you; and then,
			Phœbus Apollo! how the sleepers snore! There is every variety of this music, from the low wheeze
			of the asthmatic, to the stentorian grunt of the corpulent and profound. Nose after nose lifts up its
			tuneful oratory, until the place is vocal. Some communicative free-thinkers talk in their sleep, and
			altogether, they make a concerto and a diapason equal to that which Milton speaks of, when through
			the sonorous organ &#8216;from many a row of pipes, the sound-board breathes.&#8217; At last, morning dawns;
			you ascend into pure air, with hair unkempt, body and spirit unrefreshed, and show yourself to the
			people of some populous town into which you are entering, as you wash your face in canal water on
			deck, from a hand basin! It is a scene, I say again, take it for all in all, that throws description upon
			the parish, and makes you a pauper in words. &#8216;<em>Ohe jam satis!</em>&#8217;</p>

		<p>Let the old bachelor, who &#8216;longs but fears to marry,&#8217; perpend the annexed invitation to
		matrimony:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">Some</span> of my contemporaries have supposed that the estate of a Benedict forbiddeth the resident
			therein to disport himself as aforetime, in the flowery fields of fancy, and to ambulate at random
			through the remembered groves of the academy, or the rich gardens of imaginative delight. Verily
			this is not so. To the right-minded man, all these enjoyments are increased; the ties that bind him
			to earth are strengthened and multiplied: he anticipates new affections and pleasures, which your
			cold individual, careering <em>solus</em> through a vale of tears, with no one to share with him his gouts of
			optical salt water, wots not of. As a beloved friend once said unto me: &#8216;When a good man weds, as
			when he dies, angels lead his spirit into a quiet land, full of holiness and peace; full of all pleasant
			sights, and &#8216;beautiful exceedingly.&#8217; One&#8217;s dreams may not all be realized, for <em>dreams</em> never are; but
			the reality will differ from, and be a thousand fold sweeter, than any dreams; those shadowy and
			impalpable though gorgeous entities, that flit over the twilight of the soul, after the sun of judgment
			has set. I never hear of a friend having accomplished hymenization, without sending after him a
			world of good wishes and honest prayers. Amid the ambition, the selfishness, the heartless jostlinq
			with the world, which every son of Adam is obliged more or less to encounter, it is no common blessing
			to retire therefrom into the calm recesses of domestic existence, and to feel around your temples
			the airs that are wafted from fragrant wings of the Spirit of Peace, soft as the breath which curled
			the crystal light</p>

		<p>Here is a specimen of &#8216;the show-man&#8217;s trick,&#8217; which, as old <span class="special_name">Matthews</span> used to say,
		&#8216;made a great laugh at the time:&#8217;</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">It</span> is diverting in the extreme to observe the pompous grandiloquence in the advertisements of the
			amusement-furnishing public, about Christmas and New-Year. Sublimity glares from the theatrical
			hand-bill, and the menagerie <em>affiche</em>. Curiosities, then, have a &#8216;most magnanimous value.&#8217; I remember,
			not long ago, that I desired a lovely lady, a French countess, to accompany me to a Zoological
			Institute, to behold <em>an American Eagle</em>. I was pleased at the expressed wish which led me to
			make the invitation, and proud of the prospect of showing a living emblem of our country&#8217;s insignia
			to one who felt an interest in the subject. The bills of the institute set forth, that &#8216;the grand Columbia&#8217;s
			Eagle was the monarch of its tribe, measuring an unprecedented length from the tip of one
			wing to the other, in full plumage and vigor.&#8217; The countess had never seen but one eagle, in the
			<em>Jardin des Plantes</em> at Paris, and that was a small one, and ungrown; so that her anticipations of
			novelty were as great as mine. We went, and with interesting expectancy, asked of the president of
			the institute, who was engaged in the noble pursuit of feeding a sick baboon with little slips of cold
			pork, to discover to us &#8216;Columbia&#8217;s eagle.&#8217; He marshalled us to the other end of the institute, past
			the cages of lions, bears, libbards, and other animals&#8212;among which was a singular <em>quadruped</em>, with
			six legs&#8212;to the cage of the eagle. &#8216;There,&#8217; he exclaimed, with professional monotony, &#8216;there <em>is</em> the
			proud bird <em>of</em> our country, that <em>was</em> caught <em>in</em> the West, and <em>has</em> been thought to have killed many
			animals <em>in</em> his life-time. He <em>was</em> five hours and twenty-three minutes <em>in</em> being put into the cage, <em>so</em>
			strong <em>was</em> his wings. Look at him <em>clus</em>. He&#8217;ll bear inspection. Jist obsarve the keen <em>irish</em> of his
			eye.&#8217;</p>

			<p>&#8216;An involuntary and hearty laugh from us both, followed the sight, and the announcement. It was
			a dismal looking bird, about the size of a goodly owl, with a crest-fallen aspect, the feathers of the
			tail and wings dwindled to a few ragged quills; and the shivering fowl, standing on one leg, looked
			with a vacant, spectral eye at his visitors. Nothing could be so perfectly burlesque, and we enjoyed
			it deeply and long. I shall never be deceived by show-bills again.&#8217;</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page498" title="498"></a>The following must close our quotations. We venture to say that it describes a scene
		which many a reader has more than once witnessed:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">Talking</span> of a man&#8217;s making a hero of himself, reminds me of an old friend of mine, who is fond
			of telling long stories about fights and quarrels that he has had in his day, and who always makes his
			hearer his opponent for the time, so as to give effect to what he is saying. Not long ago I met him on
			&#8216;Change, at a business hour, when all the commercing multitudes of the city were together, and you
			could scarcely turn, for the people. The old fellow fixed his eye on me; there was a fatal fascination
			in it. Getting off without recognition, would have been unpardonable disrespect. In a moment, his
			finger was in my button-hole, and his rheumy optics glittering with the satisfaction of your true
			<em>bore</em>, when he has met with an unresisting subject. I listened to his common-places with the utmost
			apparent satisfaction. Directly, he began to speak of an altercation which he once had with an officer
			in the navy. He was relating the <em>particulars</em>. &#8216;Some words,&#8217; said he, &#8216;occurred between <em>him</em> and
			<em>me</em>. Now you know that he is a much younger man than I am; in fact, about <em>your</em> age. Well, he
			&#8216;<em>made use of an expression</em>&#8217; which I did not exactly like. Says I to him, says I, &#8216;What do you mean
			by that?&#8217; &#8216;Why,&#8217; says he to me, says he, &#8216;I mean just what I say.&#8217; Then I began to burn. There
			was an impromptu elevation of my personal dandriff, which was unaccountable. I didn&#8217;t waste
			words on him; I just took him in this way,&#8217; (here the old <em>spooney</em> suited the action to the word, by
			seizing the collar of my coat, before the assemblage,) &#8216;and says I to him, says I, &#8216;You infernal scoundrel,
			I will punish you for your insolence on the spot!&#8217; and the manner in which I shook him (just in
			<em>this</em> way) was really a warning to a person similarly situated.&#8217;</p>

			<p>&#8216;I felt myself at this moment in a beautiful predicament; in the midst of a large congregation of
			business people; an old gray-headed man hanging, with an indignant look, at my coat-collar; and a
			host of persons looking on. The old fellow&#8217;s face grew redder every minute; but perceiving that he
			was observed, he lowered his voice in the <em>detail</em>, while he lifted it in the worst places of his colloquy.
			&#8216;You infernal scoundrel, and caitiff, and villain,&#8217; says I, &#8216;what do you mean, to insult an elderly person
			like myself, in a public place like this?&#8217; and then, said he, lowering his malapropos voice, &#8216;then
			I shook him, <em>so</em>.&#8217;</p>

			<p>&#8216;Here he pushed me to and fro, with his septuagenarian gripe on my collar, as if instead of a patient
			much bored <em>friend</em>, I was his deadly enemy. When he let go, I found myself in a <em>ring</em> of spectators.
			&#8216;Shame, shame! to insult an old man like him!&#8217; was the general cry. &#8216;Young puppy!&#8217; said
			an elderly merchant, whose good opinion was my heart&#8217;s desire, &#8216;what excuse have you for your
			conduct?&#8217;</p>

			<p>&#8216;Thus was I made a martyr to my good feelings. I have never recovered from the stigma of that
			interview. I have been pointed at in the street by persons who have said as I passed them, &#8216;That&#8217;s
			the young chap that insulted old General <span class="keep_together">&#8212;&#8212;</span>, at the Exchange!&#8217;</p>

		<p>We should not omit to state that the publishers have done ample justice to the work.
		It is beautifully stereotyped and printed upon new type and fine white paper, and the numbers
		are enclosed in very neat and tasteful covers. The work we are glad to say meets with
		a liberal and constant sale.</p>

		<p class="work_reviewed"><span class="special_name">Italy and the Italians</span>. In a Series of Letters. By J. T. <span class="special_name">Headley</span>. In one volume, pp. 64.
		New-York: I. S. <span class="special_name">Platt</span>.</p>

		<p>Mr. <span class="special_name">Platt</span> has commenced a series of publications, at a moderate price, which should
		secure a liberal share of the public favor. These &#8216;Letters,&#8217; which form the initial number,
		are replete with interest. Many of them appeared in the original foreign correspondence
		of the &#8216;<em>Tribune</em>&#8217; daily journal, where they excited the admiration of the press, and &#8216;the
		people&#8217; whom the press represents; but a large portion now see the light for the first time.
		Mr. <span class="special_name">Headley</span> has not given us, in tiresome detail, minute descriptions of galleries of art
		and public edifices; although his description of St. Peter&#8217;s at Rome, (a &#8216;nice building, with
		a dome handsomely scooped out,&#8217;) is the most vivid picture of that world-renowned structure
		that we ever perused. He has wisely chosen rather to illustrate the people and country
		by things perhaps trifling in themselves, but which give to the reader a constant succession
		of &#8216;sketches from Nature,&#8217; which are not only very pleasant to read, but which it is quite
		evident are exceedingly faithful. &#8216;The condition of the people,&#8217; in short, &#8216;occupies more
		space than the condition of art, simply because the latter is well known, while the former
		is almost wholly neglected.&#8217; Briefly, for &#8216;brief must we be,&#8217; the book affords what Mrs.
		<span class="special_name">Ramsbottom</span> would call &#8216;a supreme <em>cow-dyle</em>&#8217; (coup d&#8217;œil) of &#8216;Italy and the Italians,&#8217; and
		is presented in a dress worthy of its internal merits.</p>

			<h3 class="subtitle">THE IMPUDENCE OF THE FRENCH.</h3>

			<p><span class="first_word">Keep</span> your tempers, Messieurs; we shall not quarrel. There is a difference between Impudence
			and Impertinence. The two words are often used synonymously by the vulgar,
			but they are no more alike than any other two words that begin with an I. &#8216;When we behold
			an angel, not to fear is to be <span class="small_all_caps">IMPUDENT</span>,&#8217; says <span class="special_name">Dryden</span>: &#8216;We should avoid the <span class="small_all_caps">IMPERTINENCE</span>
			of pedants,&#8217; says <span class="special_name">Swift</span>. These two great masters of the English tongue have
			well defined the difference between the two words. There is always an air of confident
			greatness about impudence that wins respect, and not infrequently success. <span class="special_name">Alexander</span>
			was assuredly the most impudent man of his time; so was <span class="special_name">Cæsar</span>; so was <span class="special_name">Luther</span>.
			Even now, when half the human race has grown impudent, we cannot but wonder at the
			impudence of that obscure monk. <span class="special_name">Galileo</span>, too, was a very impudent fellow until the
			well-bred &#8216;Rev. and dear Sirs&#8217; of his time taught him modesty. And <span class="special_name">Cromwell</span>! what
			an Arch-Impudence was he! And <span class="special_name">Napoleon</span>! he put Impudence itself to the blush. And
			have there been no Impudences among us? It cannot be denied that our Fourth-of-July-men
			made a very impudent declaration, to say the least of it. But these were all individual
			instances. The French are impudent as a nation. They have no sense of modesty.
			They insist that all the world shall eat French, drink French, talk French, dance French,
			and dress French. Did ever any traveller visit a city or town in any quarter of the globe
			in which a Frenchman had not set up a restaurant? <span class="special_name">Fanny Ellsler</span> was astonished
			when she landed at the American Hotel, to find that her dinner had been prepared by a
			Parisian cook; and yet she had come over here to show us her French steps. Simple Fanny!
			How did she think we could live without French cookery, if we could not live without
			French dancing? What traveller has ever visited a remote village that a French <em>modiste</em>
			had not visited before him? Is it possible to dine any where, without having a French bill
			of fare thrust into your hand, and some dish with an <em>à la</em> under your nose? Is there a living
			being in any part of the world willing to make oath to having visited a ball-room or a
			church without encountering a French dress or a French bonnet? The Quakers cannot;
			they would as soon wear scarlet ribbons as any other than French gloves and French
			muslins.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page500" title="500"></a>Untravelled New-Yorkers as they walk through Broadway, and see the names of Madame
			Grand-this and Mons. Grand-that &#8216;<em>from Paris</em>,&#8217; over every other shop-door, and see the
			French shoes, the French gloves, the French chocolate, the French clocks, the <em>liqueurs</em>, the
			<em>bon-bons,</em> the <em>bijouterie</em>, the <em>meringues</em>, the <em>pâtes-de-foi-gras</em>, in the windows, may think that
			the Gauls have marked us for their &#8216;own peculiar;&#8217; but it is so in St. Petersburgh, &#8217;tis so
			in Constantinople, &#8217;tis so in Lima, in the Banda Orientale, in Rio, in Mexico, in Montreal,
			in London, in Vienna, in Boston, in Philadelphia, in Grand Cairo&#8212;&#8217;tis so all over the earth.
			The Sorbonne and the Louvre rule the world. Can any body be tired, or weary, or dumpish?
			No. We must be <em>ennuyeèd</em>, or <em>blazè</em>, or <em>fatiguè</em>, or something else ending in <em>è</em>. Does
			any lady ever give an evening party? No. Nothing but a <em>soirée</em>. Are there any more
			gatherings of friends? No; only <em>reünions</em>. Is it possible to dance a cotillion in English?
			Is there any body in New-York with sufficient moral courage to sleep upon any thing short
			of a French bed-stead? Is there a chamber-maid who will lie upon any thing less than a
			<em>paliastre</em>? Are there any more fat, or plump, or round, or full people? No. Even Falstaff
			would be inclined to <em>embonpoint</em> if he were alive, in these days of Gallic supremacy.
			Well might <span class="special_name">Victor Cousin</span> and the rest of them declare that the French were not defeated
			at Waterloo. The allied armies entered Paris it is true, but they made their Exodus in
			slavery. The English, Germans and Russians went home from France manacled with
			French fashions, and not a soul of them has dared to assert his independence since.</p>

			<p>We are by no means sure that French cookery has not done more to preserve the peace
			of Europe, during the last twenty years, than all other causes put together. It is impossible
			to think of a war with France. The mind staggers under the supposititious case of the
			nations of the earth deprived of French <em>bon-bons</em>. Imagine the commerce with France
			suspended! Who would perfume us? who feast us? who dress us? Where would our
			gloves come from? what should we do for slippers? how should we be off for soap? Would
			there be any more ribbons? any more brandy fruits? any more meringues? any more
			chocolate? Where should we look for another <span class="special_name">Blancard</span>, another <span class="special_name">Fauvel-Gouraud</span>?
			Would there be any more dancing? any more fashions? any more any thing? The true
			<em>Mystéres de Paris</em> nobody knows any thing about but the Parisians themselves, and they
			are too cunning to pronounce their open sesame loud enough to be heard by the rest of the
			world. How like gudgeons we all snapped at the bait of <span class="special_name">Eugene Sue</span>! But the Mysteries
			of Paris are written in a kind of Parisian Coptic, which none but the Parisian can
			read.</p>

			<p>The English eat, or at least a portion of them do, and they cook, but who ever heard of
			an English eating-house, or of an English cook? We have heard of <span class="special_name">Dolly&#8217;s</span> chop-house,
			but its reputation was gained by the quality of its guests rather than the merit of its cooks.
			For aught the world knows to the contrary, there is not an eating-house in any of the European
			capitals beside Paris. But every body knows the names, the situation, and even the
			<em>carte du jour</em> of at least a dozen restaurants in the French capital without ever having been
			there. The &#8216;Rocher&#8217; is as well known as the Rock of Gibraltar, and Very and Châtelain
			have reputations as extended as those of Guizot and Theirs. Vatel is more famous than
			Vattel, and the cook will doubtless be remembered when the philosopher is forgotten: he
			will never die, at least, while the memory of Sevignè lives.</p>

			<p>Not long since we saw on a sign-board, stuck up at the entrance of a cellar on the corner
			of Reade-street and Broadway, &#8216;<em>Au Rocher de Cancale</em>,&#8217; painted in very soup-maigreish
			looking letters, with an attempt at the representation of an oyster-shell. Now look at the
			impudence of the thing; at the Frenchiness of it! Here we are with our Prince&#8217;s Bays,
			our York-rivers, our Mill-ponders, our Shrewsburys, and Blue pointers, a shilling&#8217;s worth of
			either worth all the shell-fish that ever grew on the French coast; and this Parisian sets
			up his sign in the midst of these marine riches, with a &#8216;<span class="special_emphasis">Rocher de Cancale</span>!&#8217; No other
			nation could have been guilty of such arrogance. No Englishman has ever had the temerity
			to insult us with an allusion to his dirty &#8216;natives.&#8217;</p>

			<p>What would be thought of an American who should have the presumption to open a
			<a class="pagenum" id="page501" title="501"></a>House of Refreshment in the Rue St. Jacques or the Palais Royale, and announce to the

			<p>Why should not we send over some of our <span class="special_name">Jenningses</span> and <span class="special_name">Stetsons</span>, our <span class="special_name">Bergalews</span>
			and <span class="special_name">Downings</span>, to repay our French friends for their many favors, and instruct them in the
			art of making pumpkin-pies and eating canvass-back ducks? The French at present
			know little more about us than that Doctor <span class="special_name">Franklin</span> made lightning-rods, and that
			<span class="special_name">Cooper</span> writes Indian novels. They eat nothing that we raise, they wear nothing that
			we make, they adopt none of our fashions, they use none of our phrases. You would look
			in vain in the <em>carte</em> of any restaurateur in Paris for such delicacies as apple-dumplings or
			corn-bread, and you might call in a Parisian café until you were hoarse, for a &#8216;cobbler&#8217; or
			a julep, without getting either. Yet our uppish people will eat nothing, drink nothing,
			wear nothing that is not French. We have been told of certain brokers in Wall-street
			who import even their <em>desserts</em> from Paris; not their <em>deserts</em>, my friend, for the guillotine
			is the only French thing which we don&#8217;t imitate or import. No wine is fit for our tables
			without the prefix of a <em>chateau</em> something; every thing that is composed of wool is something
			<em>de laine</em>, and all our clothes are made of <em>drap de</em> this or <em>drap de</em> that.</p>

			<p>But let us not paint our Gallic friends a shade darker than they deserve. They have
			taught us the use of napkins and silver forks; they give us the best perfumery in the world,
			and make the best gravies for our meats. What is the privilege of writing the songs of a
			nation, compared with the privilege of setting its fashions? The supremacy of the French
			in all matters of taste is not the effect of accident. Why do they rule the world by their
			elegancies? There is a philosophy in these things, as well as in every thing else, which
			is worthy of grave consideration.</p>

			<p>The secret of French authority lies in the simple truth that they count every thing worthy
			of being well done which is worth doing at all. We have grades of usefulness. Not so
			with them. Whether they make a pâté or build a palace, it is a grave matter; and the
			consequence is, that their pâtés as well as their palaces excel those of the other kingdoms
			of Europe. The Louvre is as much superior to Buckingham Palace as a Charlotte-Russe
			is to a Yorkshire pudding. Cookery and Architecture are the first arts practised by mankind,
			and the last in which they arrive at perfection. The French excel all other nations
			in both. The condition of one art might be ascertained with precision by examining the
			state of the other in any part of the world, or in any age. When cooks served up pastry
			with peacocks&#8217; tails sticking out of the top crust, architects built gothic churches and
			campanile towers. Penault and Vatel ornamented the same age. One built a palace and
			the other cooked a dinner, and they are both immortal. It would be no difficult matter
			to guess at the extravagance and unhealthiness of our kitchens, from a glance at our Exchange
			<a class="pagenum" id="page502" title="502"></a>and Custom House. The ponderous marble and granite boulders in these senseless
			structures have their correspondents in many a lump of indigestible food; and the
			bizarreterie of the new Trinity Church have their correspondents in many a temple composed
			of macaronis and cocoanut candies.</p>

			<p>We have grades of usefulness, but it is no easy matter to discover the principles upon
			which our scale of respect is graduated: money is not always the test of merit; it matters
			how you get it. If you earn it yourself, it will not entitle you to half the respect it would if
			your father or grandfather earned it for you. Any occupation which soils the hands or the
			clothes, is looked upon with disfavor by the upper classes. A broker who never does any
			thing that is either useful or ornamental, grows nothing, invents nothing, imagines nothing;
			who instructs nobody, amuses nobody, enriches nobody; who leaves the world in the
			same condition that he found it, may be called a gentleman, visit in the first circles, have
			those mysterious letters, <span class="small_all_caps">E.S.Q.</span>, written after his name, and if he is rich, will be elected a
			member of more societies than will be agreeable to him. But a wig-maker who has invented
			a new spring for a toupée, or a new dye for the hair, and thereby really done mankind
			a service, could no more get into the first circles with us than he could go to heaven,
			like Mahomet, on the back of an ass. Shoemakers&#8217; wives and bakers&#8217; daughters are
			people of whose acquaintance nobody ever speaks boastingly. I once knew the nephew
			of a barber who always blushed when his uncle was named in his hearing. But an
			attorney&#8217;s lady, or a banker&#8217;s daughter, are often paraded in an ostentatious manner before
			one by their friends, and I have never known the nephew of a soldier-officer, whose
			business is to take people&#8217;s lives, blush at the profession of his relative. It cannot be
			expected that men will labor in callings that gain them only the contempt of their neighbors;
			and therefore while it is accounted disgraceful among us to do any thing that is
			useful, we must be content to remain dependent upon any people who have more sense in
			regard to this matter than ourselves.</p>

			<p>We are very well aware that shoemakers and pastry-cooks are not the kind of people
			who compose the French court; but there can be no denial of the fact that certain kinds
			of artisans are treated by the French people with a greater degree of respect than they
			are with us. Very different from the dogged surliness of an Englishman, or the who-cares-for-<em>you</em>
			manner of our own countrymen, is the air of conscious self-respect of certain
			classes of French tradesmen. In the present condition of our society, we hold it to be
			among the impossible things to make a decent pastry-cook out of an American citizen, or
			a decent citizen out of a pastry-cook. But is there any good reason why we should not?
			Do not pastry-cooks contribute as much toward human happiness as sugar-refiners or importers
			of molasses? Should you not feel as well disposed toward the individual who had
			made a meringue to your liking, as toward him who had imported the materials of which
			it was composed? The King of the French seats artists at his dinner-table, bestows the
			&#8216;legion of honor&#8217; upon them; pays them liberally for their works, and settles pensions
			upon them. Artists with us, as artists, do not often find their way into our upper circles;
			if they are respectable in their habits and associates, they are rather countenanced for
			their respectability than noticed for their genius. We know a whiskey-distiller who
			refused his daughter to a portrait-painter, unless he would abandon his profession; simply
			because it was a low calling.</p>

			<p>It is very common with us to call the French triflers; but it is one of the many bad
			habits which we have inherited from the English, and the sooner we free ourselves from
			it, the better will it be for us. We shall never be ambitious to excel a people whom we
			pretend to despise. If doing small things well be trifling, then the French are triflers. But
			what must we call them for their great works? There is no art, no science, no department
			of learning in which the English excel them. They are the best architects in Europe; the
			best physicians; the best chemists, the best astronomers. They have cut off the head of
			one king and banished another; what more have the English done? But they can afford
			to be called any thing: they set the fashions of the whole world. Queen <span class="special_name">Victoria</span> is as
			<a class="pagenum" id="page503" title="503"></a>much a subject of <span class="special_name">Louis Phillipe</span> in her dress as any lady in France. With all her immense
			territory, her great authority, she cannot change the fashion of a bonnet.</p>

			<p>The difference between French and English art is as great as the difference between
			the Louvre and the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square; and about the same relative
			difference prevails with regard to us. At the last exhibition of the Louvre there were four
			thousand paintings offered; at the last exhibition of the National Academy there were
			about four hundred. This is not a very correct method of judging of the artistic excellence
			of a nation, but it is not far from correct in this case.</p>

		<div class="ed_table_item">
			<p><span class="ed_table_title">A Picture by Murillo.</span>&#8212;The time has yet to arrive when the march of empire
			<em>westward</em> will bring in its train our portion of those chef d&#8217;œuvres of painting and sculpture
			which adorn the princely palaces of Europe, and confer distinction upon the possessors
			of wealth and taste in humbler abodes. To us, who have never visited those miracles of
			art, the sight of one of them is too gratifying to be passed over without imparting a share of
			the pleasure to our less fortunate readers. For the first time in our lives, we have enjoyed
			the delight of seeing at the house of a friend one of the grand pictures of <span class="special_name">Murillo</span>, which was
			obtained by a distinguished connoisseur at Lima, in 1828, from the cloister of an old convent,
			where it had hung for countless years in ignoble seclusion. It had probably been brought
			from Spain during the life-time of the painter, as it is not described by any of his biographers,
			who have carefully enumerated the works of his pencil. This idea is strengthened
			by the fact of his having inscribed his name upon the picture, which is not to be found
			upon any of his master-pieces at Madrid and Seville. Although it has not escaped the injuries
			of time and ignorance, it appears to have had the rare good fortune never to have
			passed through the hands of a restorer or scourer: the whole effect of its magical colouring
			remains unobscured, except a few touches of the brush of some dauber, who has tried the
			experiment of adding freshness to the rose.</p>

			<p>The subject of it is the Holy Family, of life-size. Saint Joseph is seen in the background,
			with the infant <span class="special_name">Saviour</span> in his arms, presenting him to his mother, who is kneeling
			with extended hands to receive the precious burden of love. Like most of his great scriptural
			pictures, the composition is simple and natural, exhibiting a familiar scene in domestic
			life, elevated by expression, and ennobled by beauty. The Saint&#8217;s face, which is of the true
			Andalusian type, is fraught with benignity, as he graciously inclines toward the mother,
			with the infant resting tenderly in his hands as if supported by a bed of down. Nothing
			can surpass the graceful figure and attitude of the mother, whose features are literally overflowing
			with maternal affection, while she caressingly holds out her hands to receive her
			son. But the charm of the picture is the infant <span class="special_name">Deity</span> himself, upon whom the painter has
			lavished his art, and poured forth the inspiration of his genius. His position forms the
			centre of the group, and instantly arrests the attention and commands the admiration of the
			spectator. He looks as if just awakened from a deep slumber; his eye-lids are tinged with
			red, and the motion of his limbs betokens the sudden consciousness of suspended existence;
			his playful smiling features are radiant with joy at recognizing his mother, toward whom
			his hands are invitingly opened. His figure is foreshortened, and to such a degree that his
			legs are out of the canvass, instinct with life and motion. His flesh has the plumpness and
			transparency of perfect health, flushed with roseate tints; his appearance denotes a child
			of nine or ten months old, but without that expression of premature intelligence by which
			the infant <span class="special_name">Saviour</span> is distinguished in the pictures of <span class="special_name">Raphael</span>. He is, in short, just one of
			those angelic creatures fresh from the hands of the <span class="special_name">Creator</span>, oftener found in the cradles of
			peasants than of princes. The hands and feet of all the figures are painted with warmth,
			and with such sun-light transparency, that the ruddy current seems actually coursing beneath
			the skin. Indeed the whole tone of the picture is so life-like, that for the moment
			<a class="pagenum" id="page504" title="504"></a>we cease believing it to be an illusion of lights and shadows reflected upon canvass. All
			the draperies are large and flowing, and broadly touched: that of the infant is a luminous
			white; the saint&#8217;s is sombre; the mother&#8217;s is of that violet tint, said to be peculiar to <span class="special_name">Murillo</span>,
			styled by the French, <em>lie de vin</em>.</p>

			<p>In the grand compositions of <span class="special_name">Raphael</span>, we often see the actors grouped into a pyramidal
			form. In this of <span class="special_name">Murillo</span>, they present a diagonal line; extending from the head of the
			Saint to that of the mother, and down to a pannier in the corner of the picture, which contains
			her needle-work attached to a cushion in the Spanish fashion. At her feet a small
			dog is seated, of the Mexican race, which appears alive. Saint Joseph is painted in shadow,
			and forms the second plan of the picture. Behind him are suspended some of the implements
			of his humble trade.</p>

			<p>The fame of <span class="special_name">Murillo</span> out of his native country, has risen within these last ten or fifteen
			years to the highest rank, and his historical pictures are now classed with those of the
			greatest masters of the Italian school: as a colorist he is admitted to stand without a rival.
			This sudden extension of his merits is in some degree owing to the cheap acquisition of
			eight of his finest works by Marshal <span class="special_name">Soult</span>, when he was <span class="special_name">Napoleon&#8217;s</span> governor of Andalusia.
			These pictures have been seen and admired by all the world in Paris. Two of them,
			the Return of the Prodigal Son, and Abraham Receiving the Angels, have passed from the
			gallery of the illustrious Marshal to that of the Duke of Sutherland, for a <em>consideration</em>.
			The fine collection of pictures of the Spanish schools, purchased by Baron Taylor for <span class="special_name">Louis
			Philippe</span>, and now exhibited in the <span class="special_name">Louvre</span>, has contributed to the same effect. It contains
			<span class="special_name">Murillo&#8217;s</span> Virgin de la Faxa, a perfect master-piece of coloring, which cost one hundred
			and thirty thousand francs.</p>

			<p>None of his great compositions are taken from profane history or mythology. He was in
			a manner interdicted from using subjects derived from those copious sources, by a decree
			of the Holy Inquisition of Andalusia, which prohibited painters and sculptors, under the
			penalties of fine and excommunication, from displaying in their works any lascivious or
			naked images. His landscapes and flower-girls are painted in the highest style of beauty;
			and his beggars have never been excelled in all the loathsome attributes of misery and
			disease. The fact of his never having been out of his native country, disposed critics to
			believe that his works must be deficient in that highest order of merit which exclusively
			belongs to the classic schools of Italy: they would not admit that species of excellence
			which knew how to adapt the highest subjects of art to the unlearned. Yet such was
			<span class="special_name">Murillo&#8217;s</span> influence over the human heart, that his genius enabled him to embellish truth,
			and to present it with all its graces and attractions to the understandings of all those who
			are endowed with an innate love of the beautiful. His pictures, like Gray&#8217;s Elegy in a Country
			Church-yard, may with equal truth be said &#8216;to abound in images which find a mirror
			in every mind, and with sentiments to which every bosom returns an echo.&#8217;</p>

			<p>It is true that there is nothing academic to be found in his groups; no mysterious allegory;
			no theatrical display of the passions; very little of what is more talked of than understood,
			the beau-ideal. Nevertheless, he is always original, and never vulgar; his drawing is
			nearly faultless; his compositions are instantly felt and understood by all who have read
			the Scriptures, because they convey to the mind more of the evangelical character and
			attributes of Christianity than those of any other painter. On this subject some very characteristic
			remarks are made by the late Sir David Wilkie, in his letters from Jerusalem.<a href="#fn2" class="fnmarker" title="See letter to William Collins..." id="fnm2" name="fnm2">2</a></p>

			<p>&#8216;His Madonnas, his saints, and even his Saviours, have the Spanish cast; all his figures
			are probably portraits, and all his forms have a national peculiarity of air, habit, and
			countenance; and although he often adopts a beautiful expression of nature, there is generally
			a peasant-like simplicity in his ideas. He gives occasional instances of great sublimity
			of expression, but it is a sublimity which neither forces nor enlarges nature: truth
			and simplicity are never out of sight. It is what the painter sees, not what he conceives,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page505" title="505"></a>which is presented to you. Herein he is distinguished from his preceptor <span class="special_name">Velasquez</span>.
			That great master, by his courtly habits of intercourse, contracted a more proud and swelling
			character, to which the simple and chaste pencil of <span class="special_name">Murillo</span> never sought to aspire.
			A plain and pensive cast, sweetly attempered by humility and benevolence, marks his canvass;
			and on other occasions, where he is necessarily impassioned or inflamed, it is the zeal
			of devotion, the influx of pious inspiration, and never the guilty passions which he exhibits.
			In short, from what he sees, he separates from what he feels, and has within himself the
			counter-types of almost every object he describes.&#8217;</p>

			<p>If it be true, (says his biographer, <span class="special_name">Bermudez</span>,) that painters put their own portraits in
			their works, that is to say, that they exhibit their own genius, their propensities, affections,
			and the dispositions of their minds in them, the pictures of <span class="special_name">Murillo</span> bear a great
			analogy to his virtues, and the gentleness of his character. He was distinguished above
			all others of his profession by the mildness with which he instructed his pupils; by the urbanity
			with which he treated his rivals; by the humility with which he excused himself from
			becoming the painter of the Camara to <span class="special_name">Charles</span> the Second, which was offered to him by
			the court; and for the charity with which he distributed the most liberal alms to the poor,
			who afterward deplored his death. But those who were most affected by it were his beloved
			scholars, who, overwhelmed with grief and anguish, could find no consolation for
			the loss of a father who loved them most dearly; of a master who instructed them with the
			utmost kindness, and of a protector who encouraged them by giving to each such portions of
			employment as enabled them to maintain themselves. This affectionate tribute to the
			character of <span class="special_name">Murillo</span>, must recall to the minds of our readers that beautiful passage in
			the letter of <span class="special_name">Baldassare Castíglione</span> to his brother, which is said to express the feelings
			of all the artists in Rome upon the death of his friend <span class="special_name">Raphael</span>: &#8216;Ma non mi pare esser a
			Roma, perchè non vi è piu il mio poveretto <span class="special_name">Raffaello</span>.&#8217;</p>

			<p><span class="special_name">Murillo</span> was born at Magdalena, near Seville, on the first day of January, 1618, and
			died on the third of April, 1682. He was buried in the church of Santa Cruz at Seville.
			The immediate cause of his death, although he had long been worn out by the anguish of
			his infirmities, was a fall from a scaffold while he was painting the Marriage of Saint Catharine
			for the Convent of Capuchins at Cadiz. Notwithstanding the many pictures which
			he painted, he died possessed of only a few rials, and some property which he had acquired
			by his wife.</p>

				the loss of a beloved relative, who was our elder companion in childhood and youth,
				and our faithful friend and correspondent, to the close of his useful and honored life. Mr.
				<span class="special_name">Gaylord</span> died at his beautiful residence of Limerock Farm, Onondaga county, on the
				27th ultimo, after a brief illness. &#8216;Few men,&#8217; says the <em>Albany Argus</em>, &#8216;were better known
				throughout the agricultural community than Mr. <span class="special_name">Gaylord</span>. He was for many years one
				of the editors of &#8216;The Genesee Farmer,&#8217; and since the death of Judge Buel, has been the
				senior editor of &#8216;The Cultivator.&#8217; As an agricultural writer, it is not too much to say, that
				his equal is not left to mourn his loss. He was also favorably known by his contributions to
				<a class="pagenum" id="page506" title="506"></a>our literary and scientific journals. He was distinguished as a warm-hearted philanthropist,
				and few men have more largely benefitted the community by their labors. His
				social virtues endeared him warmly to all by whom he was known. In the pathetic language
				of one by whom the intelligence of his death is communicated, he was truly &#8216;the
				friend of the farmer&#8212;the friend of humanity.&#8217; We have the proceedings of a meeting of
				the New-York Agricultural Society, held in the State-House at Albany, on receiving the
				intelligence of the death of Mr. <span class="special_name">Gaylord</span>. The President, <span class="special_name">John P. Beekman</span>, Esq., of
				Columbia county, passed a high and deserved eulogium upon the character of the deceased.
				&#8216;The judgment of every intelligent farmer in the State,&#8217; he observed, &#8216;will respond
				to the assertion that to no man whatever, excepting perhaps Judge <span class="special_name">Buel</span>, is the
				agriculture of the State more indebted than to Mr. <span class="special_name">Gaylord</span>. For myself, I can declare
				in all sincerity that there is no man whose writings caused within me a greater desire to
				be honored with a personal acquaintance. The character of <span class="special_name">Willis Gaylord</span> was in
				all respects what might be expected from his writings; benevolent, enlightened, elevated;
				yet plain, practical, unassuming. Every day of his useful life was marked, not merely by
				the exercise of his versatile talents on the multifarious subjects embraced by agriculture
				and the domestic arts, but by the acquisition and promulgation of knowledge in the wide
				range of science.&#8217; He was cordially esteemed by all who knew him; he had not an enemy
				in the world. Hon. <span class="special_name">Calvin Hubbard</span>, of the Legislature, offered resolutions in testimony
				of the deep regret which the death of Mr. <span class="special_name">Gaylord</span> had created in the public mind, copies
				of which were ordered to be transmitted to the relatives of the deceased; after which, as
				a token of respect to his memory, the meeting was adjourned. &#8216;A scholar, a gentleman, a
				christian, a friend of man, Mr. <span class="special_name">Gaylord</span> lived universally beloved, and died universally
				lamented.&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">It</span> has been assumed lately by certain of the political and financial
				enemies of the late <span class="special_name">Nicholas Biddle</span>, Esq.,&#8212;an accomplished gentleman and scholar,
				whose pen has often entertained and instructed the readers of this Magazine&#8212;that he had
				little power of style, and that his intellectual rôle was a limited one. Nothing could be
				farther from the truth. That point however we are not now to discuss. We merely wish
				to ask the reader&#8217;s attention to the subjoined remarks of Mr. <span class="special_name">Biddle</span> upon the besetting
				sin of our American style, oral as well as written: &#8216;A crude abundance is the disease of
				our American style. On the commonest topic of business, a speech swells into a declamation&#8212;an
				official statement grows to a dissertation. A discourse about anything must
				contain every thing. We will take nothing for granted. We must commence at the very
				commencement. An ejectment for ten acres reproduces the whole discovery of America;
				a discussion about a tariff or a turnpike, summons from their remotest caves the adverse
				blasts of windy rhetoric; and on those great Serbonian bogs, known in political geography
				as constitutional questions, our ambitious fluency often begins with the general deluge, and
				ends with its own. It is thus that even the good sense and reason of some become wearisome,
				while the undisciplined fancy of others wanders into all the extravagances and the
				gaudy phraseology which distinguish our western orientalism.&#8217; A specimen of this &#8216;orientalism&#8217;
				we gave in our last number. Here is another example of a somewhat kindred
				character. A western orator recently delivered himself of it from the summit of a sugar-maple
				stump at a political barbacue:</p>

				<blockquote>
				<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">Whar</span>, I say <em>whar</em>, is the individual who would give up the first foot, the first outside shadow of a
				foot of the great Oregon! There aint no such individual. Talk about treaty occupations to a country
				over which the great American eagle has flew! I scorn treaty occupation; <span class="keep_together">d&#8212;n</span> treaty occupation!
				Who wants a parcel of low-flung, &#8216;outside barbarians,&#8217; to go in cahoot with us, and share alike
				a piece of land that always was and always will be ours? Nobody. Some people talk as though
				they were afeard of England. <em>Who&#8217;s</em> afeard? Haven&#8217;t we licked her twice, and can&#8217;t we lick her
				again? Lick her! Yes! just as easy as a bear can slip down a fresh-peeled sapling! Some skeery
				folks talk about the navy of England; but who the <span class="keep_together">h-ll</span> cares for the navy? Others say that she is
				the <em>mistress</em> of the ocean. Supposin&#8217; she is? aint we the <em>masters</em> of it? Can&#8217;t we cut a canal from
				the Mississippi to the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky, turn all the water into it, and dry up the <span class="keep_together">d&#8212;&#8212;d</span>
				ocean in three weeks? Whar then would be the navy? It would be <em>no whar</em>! There never would
				<em>have been</em> any Atlantic ocean if it hadn&#8217;t been for the Mississippi, nor never will be, after we&#8217;ve turned
				the waters of that big drink into the Mammoth Cave! When that&#8217;s done, you&#8217;ll see all their
				<a class="pagenum" id="page507" title="507"></a>steam-ships and their sail-ships they splurge so much about, lying high and dry, floundering like so
				many turtles left ashore at low tide. That&#8217;s the way we&#8217;ll fix &#8217;em. <em>Who&#8217;s afeard!</em>&#8217;</p>

					<h3 class="title">THE REFINER.</h3>

					<p class="byline">BY MONTGOMERY.</p>


					<div class="epigram">
						<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">He</span> is like a refiner&#8217;s fire, and like fuller&#8217;s soap. And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver:
						and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto
						the Lord an offering in righteousness.&#8217;&#8212;<span class="special_name">Malachi</span> iii. 2, 3.</p>
					</div>

					<p><span class="first_word">A few</span> ladies in Dublin, who often met together to read the Word of <span class="special_name">God</span>, one day occupied their
					attention with the passage now before the eye of the reader. One of the ladies expressed her opinion
					that &#8216;the fuller&#8217;s soap and the refiner of silver&#8217; were only the <em>same</em> image to convey the same view
					of the sanctifying influence of the grace of <span class="special_name">Christ</span>. &#8216;No,&#8217; said another, &#8216;they are not the same image;
					there is something remarkable in the expression, &#8216;<span class="special_name">He</span> shall <em>sit</em> as the refiner and purifier of silver.&#8217;&#8217;
					On going into the town, this lady called on a silver-smith, and desired to know the process of refining silver,
					which he fully explained to her. &#8216;But do you <em>sit</em>, Sir,&#8217; she asked, &#8216;while you are refining?&#8217; &#8216;Yes,
					Madam, I must sit with my eye steadily fixed on the furnace; since if the silver remain too long, it is
					sure to be injured.&#8217; She at once saw the beauty and comfort of the expression. <span class="special_name">Christ</span> sees it needful
					to put his people into the furnace, but <span class="special_name">He</span> is seated by the side of it&#8212;<span class="special_name">His</span> eye is steadily fixed on
					the work of purifying&#8212;and his wisdom and his love are both engaged to do all in the best manner
					for them. As the lady was returning to her friends, to tell them what she had heard, as she turned
					from the shop-door, the silver-smith called her back, and said, he had forgotten one thing, and that
					was, he only knew the process of refining to be complete by seeing his own image in the silver.</p>

					<p>When <span class="special_name">Christ</span> sees his own image in his people, the work of purifying is accomplished.</p>

					<p>It may be added, that the metal continues in a state of agitation, until all impurities are thrown off,
					and then it becomes quite still; a circumstance which heightens the analogy of the case; for how</p>

				<p><span class="first_word">Does</span> &#8216;M.&#8217; well to be angry? We &#8216;referred publicly&#8217; to his query touching our choice

				<span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">The</span> experiments alluded to below, in the happiest vein of the amusing
				&#8216;Charcoal-Sketcher&#8217; of Philadelphia, have been frequently tried in this city, we understand,
				but with very infrequent success. Pulling teeth while the patient is asleep is not &#8216;practised
				to a very great extent in <em>this</em> community;&#8217; for no sooner is the glittering instrument of
				torture &#8216;placed in communication&#8217; with the jaw, than it is found to &#8216;disturb the Mesmeric
				function&#8217; to an extraordinary degree:</p>

				<blockquote>
				<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">Many</span> who would be valiant in battle, turn pale at sight of the dentist&#8217;s chair. To stand up to be
				shot at in a duel is unpleasant to the nerves, and to storm a breach requires a considerable modicum
				of determination; but to pull the dentist&#8217;s bell and not to run away; to walk boldly in and not to request
				a postponement, though it gains one no laurels and probably would not help to secure a political
				nomination on the score of heroism, is pure unadulterated valor; intrinsic&#8212;deriving no aid from
				association or example; nothing from the instinct of discipline or the thirst for glory. In encountering
				other dangers, there is a large hope, too, of impunity. An expectation of survival, a fond trust to
				be with the unhurt, always exists. But here, in that morocco throne, so grotesque, so mystical, so
				strange in all its aspects; your mouth wide open and your head thrown back&#8212;what hope can there
				be? To be hurt is an inevitable thing. We are in the clutches of a fate, and must realize our mortal
				frailty. To march to this with a whistle; neither to kick the smaller dogs on our route, nor to thrust
				little children aside spitefully; to take our usual interest in the occurrences of the street as we pass
				along to execution; to laugh, to jest, to talk of the weather with the identical man as he rattles his
				glittering instruments and smiles upon their brightness; to shake hands with him and to make a tolerable
				pretence of being glad to see him, is an effort, though we may have never encountered a war,
				equal to that which wears medals and puts pensions in its pocket. There is some comfort, however,
				to the afflicted in the fact that there have been of late symptoms of a combination of animal magnetism
				with dentistry, which affords a gleam of consolation. The exhibitors in New-York frequently
				have teeth extracted from mesmerised patients, to prove that in many cases they are insensible to
				pain&#8212;a thing which has been done very often in private in this city, and in many instances with
				<a class="pagenum" id="page508" title="508"></a>complete success. What a cause for rejoicing would it be then, if the proper degree of &#8216;impressibility&#8217;
				were general with those who have failing and recreant teeth, that the dentist and his magnetiser
				might be one and indivisible? Surgery in all its branches would be benefitted by the same connection;
				but this strange physical condition is not an invariable concomitant of the mesmeric state; so
				that valor, such as that to which we have already alluded, cannot go completely out of use, even if all
				could be subjected to the nervous influence of the magnetiser.&#8217;</p>

				<p><span class="first_word">Our</span> esteemed friend, <span class="special_name">John Sanderson</span>, the distinguished &#8216;American in Paris,&#8217; whom
				the readers of this Magazine have known so long, and regarded so highly, is no more! Sad
				indeed is the task of recording the demise of a scholar so profound, a gentleman so accomplished,
				and a man so widely admired and beloved. <span class="special_name">Sanderson</span> was a delightful companion;
				and as we record this hasty tribute to his memory, we cannot help recalling the
				many pleasant passages, personal and epistolary, that we have had together. A correspondent
				of the <em>Philadelphia Gazette</em>, who knew him well, furnishes the following notice of the
				deceased, in the justice of which all who knew him will cordially concur:</p>

				<blockquote>
				<p>&#8216;<span class="special_name">John Sanderson</span> was a man of genius, a man of talent, a man of feeling. He was a Philadelphian,
				and by his life and writings he added to the good reputation of his country. To natural abilities
				of a high order, he added a calm, chaste scholarship, an intimate knowledge of mankind, a singularly
				amiable disposition, and a frank and high-bred courtesy. His departure is lamented not alone
				by those who enjoyed his society and his friendship; he is mourned by our republic of letters; America
				as well as our city, has lost one of her most accomplished sons. Mr. <span class="special_name">Sanderson</span> has long been
				known as a writer. His first publication was the collection of Memoirs of the Signers of the Declaration
				of Independence, in nine octavo volumes; a work embracing a vast amount of original and authentic
				information; and his last, excepting contributions to the literary journals, was &#8216;<em>The American
				in Paris</em>.&#8217; He was a man of most excellent humor, blending happily the characteristics of <span class="special_name">Rabalais</span>
				and <span class="special_name">Sterne</span> and <span class="special_name">Lamb</span>. When with his chosen associates, we doubt whether even <span class="special_name">Coleridge</span>
				was more entertaining or instructive. Turn to his Parisian letters and see the union of wit and
				humor, of playful satire and nice observation which pervade them. Examine all the pleasant books
				of travel of which this age has been so prolific, and answer whether they have been surpassed. &#8216;You
				know <span class="special_name">Sanderson</span>,&#8217; we said a few weeks since to a French Deputy who was travelling here. &#8216;Know
				<span class="special_name">John Sanderson</span>? I derived from him my knowledge of Paris.&#8217; &#8216;But you are a Parisian?&#8217; &#8216;<em>Je
				ne sache pas qu&#8217;il y ait eu un Français qui ait plus connu Paris et son monde.</em>&#8217; In that home of the
				gay, the brilliant and the profound, of all that in life or art attracts the man of genius, or learning, or
				taste, Mr. <span class="special_name">Sanderson</span> was the favored guest of the most celebrated savans and wits, many of whom
				since his return to the United States, have waited anxiously for his restoration to their circles. And
				he himself looked forward with happy anticipations to the renewal of his old friendships. In a few
				months he was to reöccupy his apartments in the Rue Rivoli. &#8216;There,&#8217; he said to the writer of
				these recollections but a week ago, &#8216;there with congenial spirits I shall spend the residue of my days.&#8217;
				How much those friends will sorrow when they learn that <span class="special_name">John Sanderson</span> is no more!</p>

				<p>He was a wit; he had a most delicate perception of the beautiful, and a keen sense of the ludicrous.
				But those who knew him can tell with what care he directed his powers. He never summoned a
				shadow to any face, or permitted a weight to lie on any heart. He was as amiable as he was brilliant.
				He was no man of the world. He knew society, its selfishness and its want of honor, but he
				looked upon it less in anger than in sadness. He was no cynic, no Heraclitus; he deemed it wisest
				to laugh at the follies of mankind. Through all his experience he lost none of his natural urbanity,
				his freshness of feeling, his earnestness and sincerity. The late <span class="special_name">Theodore Hook</span>, the first humorist
				and most celebrated bon-vivant of our day, was employed by his publisher to edit Mr. <span class="special_name">Sanderson&#8217;s</span>
				&#8216;American in Paris.&#8217; He read it, adapted it as well as he could to the English market, and returned
				<a class="pagenum" id="page509" title="509"></a>it with the observation that &#8216;there was never a book which suffered more from slightest change.&#8217; Had
				the author devoted the chief portion of his time to letters, he would have been little less distinguished
				in the same department than his famous friend. But he lived a quieter and happier life; he died a
				happier death, suddenly, but in a <em>home</em>, and with his friends about him.&#8217;</p>

				<p><span class="first_word">We</span> have repeatedly in these pages &#8216;borne testimony&#8217; in behalf of a more general cultivation
				of the fine arts, and especially in the department of architecture. We have had too
				much reason to concur with <span class="special_name">Jefferson</span> in the opinion that &#8216;the genius of architecture
				never yet condescended to visit the American Republic.&#8217; The Count <span class="special_name">Renault</span> St. <span class="special_name">Jean</span>
				<span class="keep_together">D&#8217;A&#8212;&#8212;</span> was wont to say, while residing among us, that &#8216;more was to be learned by
				viewing Grace-Church in Broadway, touching the state of mental culture among us in the
				science of architecture, than by all the methods of reasoning which philosophy could furnish
				on any abstract point of knowledge;&#8217; and yet we believe the plan of this edifice was
				the result of a confederation of intellectual powers! Moreover, as our old friend, the late
				Gen. <span class="special_name">Morton</span>, was wont to say, we must bear in mind that beside the several recognized
				orders of architecture, we have also an <em>order by the corporation</em>! We may have more to
				say on this theme on another occasion. We have been led to these incidental remarks, by
				the recent death in this city of a man of rare genius, and unwearied effort in the promotion of
				a kindred branch of art&#8212;<span class="special_name">Thomas Horner</span>, of England, the well-known draftsman and
				painter of the wonderful panorama of London, which constitutes the attraction of the great
				collosseum in that metropolis. The labor to affect this great work, the result of years of
				toil and severe exposure to the inclemencies of a noxious atmosphere, doubtless predisposed
				to that prolonged suffering which wasted his physical strength; while sad disappointments,
				and the precarious means of existence which he derived from his art in this country, may
				be justly regarded as concurring causes in hastening his final departure from among us.
				For a period of about fifteen years, he had devoted himself to the taking of sketches of
				numerous rural views and edifices in different parts of our northern states, and of the public
				buildings of our prominent cities. His delineation of the city of New-York is perhaps the
				most conspicuous of the efforts of his pencil. He died in this city on the morning of the
				18th of March, aged about sixty years. It may be gratifying to his relatives and friends
				abroad to know, that there were not a few of our citizens who were ready at all times to
				aid him by their benefactions; and that in his illness he found in Dr. <span class="special_name">Francis</span>, whose name
				is a synonyme for considerate kindness, a constant friend and faithful medical adviser. His
				funeral was attended by some of our first citizens, among whom it was gratifying to observe
				Mr. <span class="special_name">Fowler</span>, the President of the St. George&#8217;s Society, and other well-known countrymen
				<a class="pagenum" id="page510" title="510"></a>of the deceased. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">Our</span> correspondent, Mr. <span class="special_name">Thos. Copcutt</span>, has opened the present
				number with an admirable paper, compiled from Carlyle, on the never-tiring theme
				of <span class="special_name">Napoleon</span>. We always associate, and at once, with <span class="special_name">Napoleon&#8217;s</span> name, the dreadful
				scenes presented by his deserted battle-fields; such for example as marked the sanguinary
				contests of his Russian campaign. Here is a sketch of one, from the pen of an eye-witness:
				&#8216;The battle-field presented a terrible picture of ruin and carnage, especially on the
				left and centre, where the greatest efforts had been made to take, maintain, and retake the
				redoubts. Corpses of the slain, broken arms, dead and dying horses, covered every elevation
				and filled every hollow, and plainly indicated the progress of the action. In the front
				of the redoubts lay the bodies of the French; behind the works, showing that they had
				been carried, lay the Russians. On many points the heaps of corpses told where squares
				of infantry had stood, and plainly pointed out the size of the closely formed masses. From
				the relative number of the slain, it was easy to perceive that the Russians had suffered
				more than the French.&#8217; And this is but one of hundreds of similar scenes! Yet, &#8216;had
				these poor fellows any quarrel? Busy as the Devil is, not the smallest! Their <em>Governors</em>
				had fallen out!&#8217; If one could indulge a &#8216;grim smile&#8217; at any thing in relation to <span class="special_name">Bonaparte</span>,
				it would be at the potential <em>military</em> standard to which he reduced every thing. Do you
				remember his order on the appearance of the Mamelukes in Egypt? Form square; artillery
				to the angles; asses and savans to the centre!&#8217; Characteristic; but complimentary that,
				to the &#8216;learned savans!&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">We</span> have bestowed but little of our tediousness upon the
				reader in this department of the present number, whereat he may felicitate himself, since
